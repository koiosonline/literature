# BC-2.5.4 Nodes 

You can catch up with the digital time itself and review the entire history by downloading the blockchain ledger. A “client” software downloads the blockchain (transaction history). You become a recordkeeper, another copy of the distributed ledger among “client nodes”. The fastest way to align with others and do the integrity check: do we have the same hash as others nodes?

We already described the nodes in a previous class, where we showed you the hardware. You can quickly become one yourself. [Check out this site and become a bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node). It does require a lot of bandwidth and memory storage on your hardware device.
