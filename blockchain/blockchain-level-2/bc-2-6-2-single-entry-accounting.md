# BC-2.6.2 Single Entry Accounting 

Single-entry accounting is a form of bookkeeping and accounting. It is also known as profit & loss recording. Each financial transaction is a single entry in a journal or transaction log (the single-entry system approach). It does not have a balance, only a revenue overflow of what comes in and goes out. It does not work for all cases because you can not determine balance positions. Balance positions are needed to determine debts, stock positions, and other momentums. 

It does not require training in accounting. A few businesses choose single-entry accounting instead of the more common double-entry system. With the single-entry approach, each financial event calls for just one accounting system transaction. This approach is similar to the way that individuals use a check register (see picture). Firms using a single-entry method are effectively limited to reporting on a [cash-based accounting system]( https://www.business-case-analysis.com/cash-basis-accounting.html). You either have the asset, or you don’t. Simple, but limited: It does NOT allow recording debits or credits. You also can’t periodically depreciate assets. You can’t record time aspects.

## Bitcoin and single-entry accounting

But a benefit is that you don’t need complicated accounting rules! Bitcoin combines computing with a cash-based accounting system. You either own the data/bitcoin, or you don’t. The data, the assets knowns as bitcoins, are also called [Unspent Transaction Output]( https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utxo.asp). 

>💡 These “UTXO” are the number of spendable bitcoins.
