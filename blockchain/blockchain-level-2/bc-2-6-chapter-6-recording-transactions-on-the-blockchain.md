# BC-2.6.1 Transactions 


## About this chapter?

This session is all about the game's ball: recording transactions (also known as "accounting"). This recording of a transaction is like passing around the ball in a ballgame. Depending on the game, the value and speed of the transaction differ per blockchain, just as in sports. Remember the scalability trilemma? Some blockchains are well-suited for high-value transactions. Others seem better equipped for faster microtransactions. 

## What will we discuss? 

BC-2.6.1 Once more: what are transactions? 

BC-2.6.2 Single entry accounting 

BC-2.6.3 Double entry accounting

BC-2.6.4 "Triple" entry accounting 

BC-2.6.5 Example: how does a blockchain transaction work on Bitcoin 

BC-2.6.6 Example: how does a blockchain transaction work on Ethereum 

BC-2.6.7 Component approach

BC-2.6.8 Addendum (extra / optional!) 


## By the end of this lesson, I can:

Explain what single, double, and triple entry accounting is (understand)
Break down transactions on Bitcoin and Ethereum on a higher web-based level (analyze)
