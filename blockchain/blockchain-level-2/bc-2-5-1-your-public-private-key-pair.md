# BC-2.5.1 Your public-private key pair

There is nothing new here: we already discussed the keys, so only a short recap this time. However, we do provide more details in level 3.

We have, as you know, public/private key pairs. The private key is nothing more than a very, very large number (approx. between 1^77 = 2^256 in the case of Bitcoin). For comparison: current science states that there are between 1078 to 1082 atoms in the known, observable universe. The public key is nothing more than a hash of a hash, often using different hashing formulas, rendering it virtually impossible to calculate back to the original number. (“chances of succeeding are as big as being hit by a comet within 2 seconds”).

But….what do we do with this key pair? Send (private) and receive (public) data transactions (often this data presents some form of value, like a bitcoin).

>💡 So tool #1 is like the bat you need in baseball to move the ball. No keys = no bat = no game.
