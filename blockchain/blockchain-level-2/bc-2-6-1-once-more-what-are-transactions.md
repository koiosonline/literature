# BC-2.6.1 Once more: what are transactions?

This session is all about the ball in the game: the transactions. No ball = no game. It is all about sending value from one to another with blockchains. And that is hard to do without transacting. 

We first start this chapter with a short recap overview of transactions and the different accounting ways to records. After you have learned these fundamental elements, we will explain how transactions work on Bitcoin and Ethereum. This way, we have covered most of the different types of transactions being sent around the world. We invite you to dig out other variants on your own! 

## Refresher
So let’s start with the beginning. What were transactions again? 

[Transactions in short]( http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/transaction.html). As you know, we use transactions to send value from entity A to B. Value in the digital realm is represented by data (bits & bytes). 

>💡 Blockchains either fully transfers the data (= processed in totality) or nothing at all. 
If a transaction is deemed valid by the protocol, the miners and minters record them, as you know now. If they aren’t valid, they are ignored. You can always try to send invalid transactions, but miners won’t record them. And no recording, means no value transfer. 

>💡 Where the internet enables us to transfer information, a blockchain additionally allows us to transfer value. Blockchains bring the internet to an entire new level! 

[This article]( https://medium.com/@permabullnino/bitcoin-an-accounting-revolution-40efcb903d7b)  explains why bitcoin can be seen as an accounting revolution. It portrays an overview and history of accounting & audit, all the way leading up to the lightning network. A must-read for our students, as you may have seen in the portfolio already 😉! In short: it explains the migration from single entry accounting to “triple entry accounting”.
