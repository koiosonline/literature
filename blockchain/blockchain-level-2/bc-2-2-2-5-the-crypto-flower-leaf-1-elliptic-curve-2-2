# BC-2.2.2.5 Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)! 2/2 


## Introducing Mnemonic words and BIP-38

Additional to the previous session: To make your private key easier to remember, somebody invented the BIP 38 Mnemonic words, which chopped up your 256-bit key into 12-24 pieces of bits. Every string (of 12 bits in case of 24 words, so actually > 256 bits key) represents a word. More about this later, for now: remember that the 24 words you sometimes see = your private key = 24 individual strings of 12 bits = each string is one word according to a certain dictionary.

**Therefore, NEVER reveal those words to anybody because that is your "password" (you can't change it, because that would lead to a different number (= different private key) which would lead to a different public key.**


You have made it through the very first leaf: cryptography. So take a breather, and we will see you in the second one: distributed systems and consensus.
