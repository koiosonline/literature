# BC-2.3.1 Blockchain layers ‚Äì the different positions in the field (1/2)

This session will discuss the different positions you can partake within that blockchain technology ecosystem. We will use the sports analogy once more. As with sports, you can divide the field into categories like offense or defense. But also within those categories (left, right). It is the same thing when we discuss positions in a blockchain or a blockchain ecosystem. Just as different ball games will lead to other positions, the same could go for protocols. 

You have the luxury of deciding where to join. Many of the protocols out there are openly accessible. Would I like to play defense (become a miner or a node), or do I like to attack (white/grey/black-hat hacker)? Just as in sports, you can select based on your talents and interests. But just as with sports, you can have various roles depending on the situation. 

## The blockchain stack 

In the overview below, you will see different layers of a blockchain, called stacks. There are many other different representations possible, but this one gives a decent basic overview. The blockchain stack consists in general out of: 


* An infrastructure layer 

* Network layer


* Protocol layer

* Service layer

* Application layer (incl. browser)

## The stack explained 
When we compare a blockchain technology stack with soccer, we will start with the goalie (in the back of the field). This analogy would be the outer line of defense, the core layer, and the infrastructure. It is the backbone of the infrastructure, also known as the "back end" of the system. Decisions here will impact all the other layers. In this layer, the type of hash, etc.  

If we have decided about those essentials, we need to figure out how to communicate between these miners, nodes, and the network. How will we send the packages between entities (GETH, for example, in Ethereum)? This is also known as the network layer and can be seen as the goalie shouting out orders to the defenders, setting up the defense, and creating structure. And a shared language for players to communicate in the field. Without communication, the entire ecosystem (team) will fall apart. 

But even with core elements and communication between peers, we need to have some rules to align each team player towards the end goal. For this, we use a set of rules, which is, as you know, called the protocol layer. Here we decide what the truth is and build upon the core elements given in the infrastructure. Of course, consensus can adjust during the game, like the forks of Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum Classic have proven. Still, the core elements in the infrastructure often remain the same. 

We have a shared understanding if we know and understand the core elements, how we communicate within the team, and the rules we need to follow. This is a good starting point to start building services and add-ons on your layers. This is also where you move towards the front end (more visible for users). Here we see wallets for users arise and interact with the outside world of oracles. This could be seen as the midfield, an essential bridge between the back end and the front end in the sports analogy. 

One of the final layers (depends on what overview you use) is the front-end application layer. This is where we "score", where blockchains should deliver the value according to their goals. In short: offering applications that offer an increased transaction cost efficiency and fewer TTP risks, for example. An Ethereum dApp store, for example, where you earn money with your data. Users perhaps don't even notice that their apps are running on blockchain technology. They reap the benefits without realizing what the rear engine is (the different layers as discussed). 

## Under the hood 
The stack overview gives a good insight into joining somewhere, but it should not matter if you are only an end-user. For example, how many people use the internet but have no idea how it works? We expect blockchain will have a similar effect on people who use dApps. They earn money with it and have better security, privacy, transparency, etc., but probably have no idea how it works. Nevertheless, it is an infrastructure of the future, so understanding the above provides a decent edge in selecting your position! 

## You move across the field 
As with sports: every individual plays an essential role in the team. For example, sometimes, the goalkeeper (back end) is necessary for survival. Another time the goal scorer is the hero of the group ("the killer app"). **We are all in this team together, and your role in the ecosystem and crew can be essential**. 

>üí° You can also shift between positions and be active in multiple layers, which we suggest because you understand the "game" better if you have been in numerous spots. 

 

>üí° The digital world exists alongside the physical one but is getting more significant in our lives by the day. It is brand new and full of opportunities!

How does your choice for which leaf you want to specialize in fit in the blockchain stack? Is there overlap, or does it allow you to scope your interest down even further?
