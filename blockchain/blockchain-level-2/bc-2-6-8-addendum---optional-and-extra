The information is a bit outdated, but perhaps still interesting to read. 


## 2.6.8 – Recording data in the blockchain via transactions

Fun Fact: You can leave texts & messages to future generations in other ways. Registered on the blockchain of Bitcoin -> Nelson Mandela tribute "Education is the most powerful weapon that you can use to change the world. But how does this work?   


## How to stamp coins (colored coins) 
Colored coins are bitcoins (or more probably, the smallest measurable fraction of a bitcoin called a 'Satoshi') that have been 'colored' to represent another asset, such a share in a company, a US Treasury bond, one US cent, a derivative, a car loan, or a fraction of a collateralized debt portfolio. 

OP_RETURN = record data on the ledger, for example, "this Satoshi represents one share of Heineken". Therefore you could "liquify" assets (make them tradeable) and create entirely new markets and even new money. Not yet mature enough, though, for global adoption, it gives insight into possibilities with programmable money!

A way to record data is via the command OP_Return. So, for example, you can record 80 bits of data in that transaction, giving that particular UTXO a brand. 
People record much privacy-related stuff via the op_return command, like connections to their real-world identities (websites, social media, etc.). This way, your identity can be connected tied to your bitcoin addresses via an op_return analysis. [More about this can be found here]( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01024.pdf)

One other use case for OP_RETURN is coloring coins. Coloring coins is like writing your name on a 1$ bill, only this time you are writing data on a digital token like bitcoin to represent something (could still be your name ☺). A stamp can be removed, not to be mixed up with "burning" tokens which can't be undone. We do suggest to stamp tiny amounts of bitcoin ;-) 
Andreas Antonopoulos explains more about this concept in [this 7-minute video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2FaaLS9vqE). Prefer to read? See ahead. 

From [Mastering Bitcoin]( https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) (p. 221)
Colored Coin is a meta-protocol that overlays information on small amounts of bitcoin. A "colored" coin is an amount of bitcoin repurposed to express another asset. Imagine, for example, taking a $1 note and putting a stamp on it that said, "This is a one share certificate of Acme Inc.". Now the $1 serves two purposes: it is a currency note and also a share certificate. Because it is more valuable as a share, you would not want to use it to buy candy, so effectively, it is no longer helpful as currency. Colored coins work in the same way by converting a specific, tiny amount of bitcoin into a traded certificate representing another asset. The term "color" refers to the idea of giving special meaning through the addition of an attribute such as a color - it is a metaphor, not an actual color association. There are no colors in colored coins.

Colored coins are managed by specialized "wallets" that record and interpret the metadata attached to the "colored" bitcoins. Using such a wallet, the user will convert several bitcoins from uncolored currency, into colored coins, by adding a label that has a special meaning. For example, a label could represent stock certificates, coupons, real property, commodities, collectible tokens, etc. It is entirely up to the users of colored coins to assign and interpret the meaning of the "color" associated with specific coins. To color the coins, the user defines the related metadata, such as the type of issuance, whether it can be subdivided into smaller units, a symbol and description, and other related information. Once colored, these coins can be bought and sold, subdivided, aggregated, and receive dividend payments. The colored coins can also be "uncolored" by removing the particular association and redeem them for their face value in bitcoin.
