# BC-2.7.4 Fat Protocols

So the goal is to transform from the Tragedy of the Commons to the Wealth of the Commons. The question stated in [this Medium post about crypto commons]( https://blog.usejournal.com/crypto-commons-da602fb98138) is legit: how can crypto-powered businesses create new types of abundance? 

Of course, there are often [initial investments]( https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~carsonvs/papers/201(299).doc) needed to build these commons. Joel Monegro’s [fat protocol thesis](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/) is a fundamental idea in that regard, and we highly recommend this short read. To summarize the article: the value transfers from the “fat” (= valuable) application layer in to the thin protocol layer. 

In web2 we have a thin protocol layer with current protocols like the internet. The internet itself misses much value, but applications like Google, Facebook, and Uber do receive value. It is the other way around with blockchains: the more people that use the blockchain, the more valuable the protocol layer will become. Because of the open-source character and transparency in open public blockchains, applications can’t catch much value (because they are easily copied and improved by others). 

To give a comparison: on the internet, you can build big companies in closed-off environments, like Google and Apple, that are getting increasingly bigger and bigger because they can harvest data and hide their algorithms. In open blockchain environments, not only is the data accessible by everyone but so is your code. The value is therefore not be caught by one party that builds the application but by the protocol. Captured by the tokens, the currency, active in that specific protocol.

Because some of you might not read the article, we copy an important of it: 

*“…the main point remains: by replicating and storing user data across an open and decentralized network rather than individual applications controlling access to disparate silos of information, we reduce the barriers to entry for new players and create a more vibrant and competitive ecosystem of products and services on top. As a concrete example, consider how easy it is to switch from Poloniex to GDAX, or any of the dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges out there, and vice-versa in large part because they all have equal and free access to the underlying data, blockchain transactions. Here you have several competing, non-cooperating services that are interoperable by building their services on top of the same open protocols. This forces the market to find ways to reduce costs, develop better products, and invent radical new ones to succeed.*
*….This is a significant shift. The combination of shared open data with an incentive system that prevents “winner-take-all” markets changes the game at the application layer. It creates an entirely new category of companies with fundamentally different business models at the protocol layer. Many established rules about building businesses and investing in innovation don’t apply to this new model and today. We probably have more questions than answers. But we’re quickly learning the ins and outs of this market through our blockchain portfolio. In typical USV fashion, we’re going to share that knowledge as we go along.”*
