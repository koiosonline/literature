# BC-2.5.7 Protocols & communication

Bitcoin uses a simple broadcast network to propagate transactions and blocks. All communications are done over TCP. Bitcoin is fully able to use ports other than 8333 via the -port parameter. IPv6 is [supported](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=81378.0) with Bitcoind/Bitcoin-Qt v0.7. Using bitcoin over [tor]( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor) is also supported. A good source in general: [about the Bitcoin network]( https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Network).

The Transmission Control Protocol is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation, in which it complemented the Internet Protocol. Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.
