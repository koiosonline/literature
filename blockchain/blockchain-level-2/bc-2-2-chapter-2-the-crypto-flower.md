# BC-2.2 Chapter 2 The crypto flower

## About this chapter? 
Different blockchains have different properties. This session is all about categorizing the various properties in the main areas. We use a very scientifically created and supported (ü°® sarcasm) Twitter-created overview we like, known as ‚Äúthe crypto flower‚Äù. 

**The ball game analogy introduces the different fields (= set of blockchain properties) used in almost all the other blockchains (= games from chapter 1).** 

## What will we discuss?

BC-2.2.5 The crypto flower leaf 4: Game-theory


## Learning goals
By the end of this lesson, I can: 
categorize and break down the different set of properties of distributed ledgers (analyze)
evaluate which properties settings in a blockchain can lead to which properties of the network and therefore which possible use cases are suited (evaluate)
analyze a random blockchain and, based on the collected information, assess whether the blockchain is well-suited for their described main goal name the strengths and weaknesses of a blockchain or other form of distributed ledger-based on the core properties (evaluate)
analyze the impact of a change in properties and their impact on the goal of that network
