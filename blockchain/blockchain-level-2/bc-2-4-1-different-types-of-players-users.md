# BC-2.4.1 The different types of players - the users 


There are many different types of people, organizations, and other entities involved in blockchain ecosystems. A short (and most likely not complete) overview of some standard players: 


* Users 

* Miners & minters

* Nodes & Validators

* Developers

* Other ecosystem entities 

* Open-sourced ecosystem

In this part 2.4, we will briefly discuss them and finally discuss who’s in control (or isn’t in power): the blockchain bootstrap. Let’s start with the first player in the field and one of the most important ones: the final end-user using the technology.  

## The user
On the blockchain, nobody knows you are a forest. Huh? What? What does this mean? For the first time in human history, machines and other autonomous entities can now own their own private keys. Because value is fully digitalized, bits and bytes can directly send other bits and bytes (data) and keep it and hold it. Thanks to the public/private key combination representing a digital identity, in combination with the automated smart contracting system (no need for human intervention). So whether you are a machine or you are a human, you can hold your private key. As you now know, this is just a vast number, mixed via ECDSA, hashed and presented as a public key in the outside world.     

So this means blockchain technology enables and supports new technologies like the internet of things way better than centralized systems (because of lower transaction costs = more efficiency). Combine this with the fact that machines and cars and all kinds of other hardware. Lantern posts or washing machines can now become autonomous and self-sustainable (take care of themselves). You could have a self-driving car that only starts driving when it receives money and instructions. It will know when to get maintenance, pay the garage, and earn more than it costs. It can even buy a second self-driving car. Before you know it, we only have self-driving cars. 

>💡 A blockchain doesn’t care who owns the private key of a public address. 

 

>💡 The web3 technologies can not only remove Uber as the intermediary but even the cab driver!

 <blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac">❓ Let the above sink in a bit. What other opportunities and self-sustainable systems do you foresee? </blockquote>

How’s that for innovation 😊? This enormous impact on society opens up a box of dilemmas, but this doesn’t mean this isn’t a possible future. On the contrary, it is technically within reach. Whether desired, we’ll leave it up to you. But do remember: so far, people have most often chosen the most efficient way to transact, even if that meant losing jobs, opening up new discussions, etc. 

Is the above too far from your bed show? Unrealistic? Check out this DAO forest [experiment]( https://blockchainhub.net/blog/art-videos/self-sustaining-ai-dao-forest/) in Germany, where a forest and the surrounding village provide for itself.
## Conclusion 
Automated transaction recording and private keys held by machines or contracts can lead to new autonomous organizations. Like a DAO forest or a DAO cab company. We are in the very early stages. New economics models, organizations, and commons are built for the next decades to come. But with better design properties like transparency, self-ownership, etc. 

But who will do all the recording and security? That’s right: the miners and minters. So let’s hop on to the next session! Do embrace yourself, the next session got a bit out of hand and resulted in quite a long session. Apologies, sometimes our enthusiasm brings us no good.
