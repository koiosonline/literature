# BC-2.7.3 The rules for successful commons

While the original work on the tragedy of the common concept suggested that all commons were doomed to failure, they remain essential in the modern world. Work by later economists has found many examples of successful commons, and [Elinor Ostrom]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom) won the Nobel prize for analyzing situations where they operate successfully.

For example, Ostrom found that grazing commons in the Swiss Alps have been run successfully for hundreds of years by farmers. Allied to this is the "comedy of the commons" concept, where users of the commons can develop mechanisms to police their use to maintain and possibly improve the state of the commons.

Another related concepts are the inverse commons. It is argued that some types of commons, such as [open-source software]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), work better in the cornucopia of the commons. Proponents say that, in those cases, "the grass grows taller when it is grazed on". Other examples of successful open source projects (other than Linux):

## The rule of eight
According to Elstrom her research, the following eight principles need to be held uphold. Then, check critically (always critically!) for yourself if the fundamental properties of blockchain sufficiently act according to all these principles.

rules are clear
the community shares rules
decision-making is democratic
conflict resolution is local and public
sanctions are graduated
cheap & accessible conflict resolution
users themselves check compliance with rules
rules don't conflict with higher laws

From [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom):  

Clearly defined (clear definition of the contents of the common pool resource and effective exclusion of external un-entitled parties
The appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions
Collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process
Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators
A scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules
Mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access
Self-determination of the community recognized by higher-level authorities
In the case of more considerable common-pool resources, an organization has multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local CPRs at the base level.

## The eight rules & blockchain
Do open public blockchains fully match these properties? Just think about bitcoin not being accepted in every region (#8) or the centralized decision-making in open public blockchains as seen with Bitcoin developers pushing through upgrades or Ethereum Forks (#3). Not yet (?) a perfect match.  Luckily this is something we can all work on.

Comparing current society and current open public blockchains opens up room for debate and, with it, many new routes for improvement. It is a two-edged sword if you are the current form of governance (Government of a country, for example). If you don't move forward to a better Common Infrastructure, we don't seem to tackle these global challenges. Global challenges ask for global infrastructure. But will you as a government install new legislation as long as open public blockchain still harbor centralized components? We can only imagine that current centralized institutions like governments won't be happy to transfer their new laws to new centralized entities. Ignoring whether you can stop this decentralized new global decentralized infrastructure with local regulations (take Venezuela & Bitcoin, for example).

Another question/food for thought: how well does the current centralized infrastructure of governments and companies score in this rules-set for the Commons? Do you know how to understand the "use-case" of open public blockchains? It is to build a new infrastructure for the commons. Whether that is global money (bitcoin) or global governance (Ethereum), the aim is to become a globally adopted digital common. Built by everybody, governed by everybody, for everybody. Just remember, though: we are very far away from that ideal situation, and we always need to remain very critical, but with an open mind!
