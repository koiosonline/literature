# BC-2.1 Chapter 1 overview DLT 

## About this chapter?
As you know, blockchain technology is ledger technology. A distributed ledger, to be more precise. But the spectrum of different types of distributed ledgers is large. So in this session, we introduce the main categories of other distributed ledgers, each with its strengths and weaknesses. You might know more significant parts already from previous level content or found during #DYOR, so this intro chapter can best be seen as a quick recap and your warming up â˜º 

**Ball game analogy: this chapter is introducing the different games out there**
