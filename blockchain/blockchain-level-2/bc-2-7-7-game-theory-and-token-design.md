# BC-2.7.7 Game theory & Token design

Incentives, incentives, incentives, we humans seem to be all about incentives ðŸ˜Š Key questions: "How do we motivate an entity to behave a certain desired way". Not only do you need to (1) determine what is "desired / not desired," and not only do you (2) need to know who all the entities areâ€¦you also (3) need to influence their behavior a certain way. The first two questions mainly relate to the ecosystem challenge and how to create insight into this ecosystem. "Game Theory" is all about the third question: (dis)stimulate entities.

Luckily for you, this was done before there were blockchains and computers ðŸ˜‰ There is a lot of information on this topic, and I, as an economic, am very interested in this field. Therefore, economics can be seen as social behavioral and is a (big) part of this Game Theory field (another significant component is psychology). Let's start with the very basics in this basics course. Later in other levels, we will dive way and way deeper into these materials: [what is game theory?]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHS-htjGgSY).

And a bit more elaborated [one applied on economic theories]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCcVODWm-oY).

## Token design

How does this apply to blockchain technology, though? Just as game theory is about the interaction between entities, we use blockchains to transfer value, which is also an interaction between entities. As you might have noticed in the above video's, in-game theory, you often (1) use "value" as an incentive, which can be monetary or time like a prison sentence or other values, or (2) you would need a proven history and transparency to base your actions on. Therefore, a blockchain-based infrastructure offers a perfect foundation for game theory since it can send (micro)values and is a transparent and immutable ledger. In short: we use cryptocurrencies and tokens and badges and stuff to incentivize entities. Just think about the Bitcoin protocol rewarding miners to validate transactions in the network's native currency (bitcoin).

The "token design" is, therefore, an essential element to reach your final goal. For example, suppose you want to offer secure borderless decentralized money. In that case, the design of the protocol and its inherent token should be entirely focused on how to reach that goal. Bitcoin is therefore well equipped to acquire security (hashing power) but less so in creating new forms of governance. Ethereum, for example, is the other way around because their end goal seems to be different. They don't want to offer a secure value transfer layer. Bitcoin is covering that market. Instead, they focus on creating decentralized applications harboring and facilitating new forms of governance like decentralized finance, web 3.0, or other centralized infrastructures that would improve in a decentralized fashion. As you might have guessed already: if you make changes in the token design, you might end up changing the end goal of your blockchain network.

Because this field of game theory is so large, there are many different games (Common-payoff games, Zero-sum games, Evolutionary games) and dilemmas (like, for example, the prisoner's dilemma). We will devote an entire section about this topic to the next level.
