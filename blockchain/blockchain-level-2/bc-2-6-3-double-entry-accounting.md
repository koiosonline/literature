# BC-2.6.3 Double-entry Accounting

According to historiography, the current bookkeeping method arose in 1491 Venice. Doube-entry accounting allows us to prepare both a balance sheet and the profit and loss account from single-entry accounting (enabling debts and credits!). The critical thing about accounting 2.0 is that every transaction in the accounting must be in balance (debit = credit!). This way, the total financial equation is not disturbed. You can find a more detailed explanation here [explaining how double-entry accounting works]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijPDIy6gXxc).
 
## A balance sheet is capturing a specific moment in time

The single-entry approach contrasts with [double-entry accounting]( https://www.business-case-analysis.com/double-entry-system.html), in which every financial event brings at least two equal and offsetting entries (similar in amount!). One is a debit (DR) and the other a credit (CR), resulting in an [accrual reporting system]( https://www.business-case-analysis.com/accrual-accounting.html).

>ðŸ’¡ Instead of only focus on Revenues and Expenses, you can now also focus on Assets, Liabilities, and Equities.

A double-entry system keeps the firm's entire ["Chart of accounts" in view]( https://www.business-case-analysis.com/account.html). This chart for a double-entry system has, in fact, five kinds of accounts in two categories:
Firstly, Income statement accounts: (1) Revenue accounts and (2) expense accounts.
Secondly, Balance sheet accounts: (3) Asset accounts, (4) Liability accounts, and (5) Equity accounts.

These "balance sheet accounts" are new in double-entry accounting and are like a frozen moment in time (for example, the 31st of December 2019). Thus, the income statement is a flow of time (for example, "2019"). In other words: the balance sheet is a snapshot of the income statement, enabling us to record assets (debits) and liabilities (credits).

## An example

All transactions in a double-entry system result in entries in at least two different accounts. So when the company receives cash through a bank loan, the double-entry system records:

Firstly, a debit (DR) for an asset account, e.g., Cash on hand. For an asset account, a DR is an increase.
Secondly, a credit (CR) to a liability account, e.g., bank loans. A CR to a liability account increases its balance.

With double-entry accounting, you can introduce time aspects in recording and, for example, record debt (money that somebody will pay you in the future). Like mentioned: A double-entry system keeps the firm's entire "Chart of accounts" in view. In other words: it presents "the state" of the income statement, just like Ethereum presents the world state of transactions per block.

## Closed-off environments
The administration is often conducted in private accounting. In closed-off environments. It does not work optimally because these accounting ledgers can't or won't communicate with each other, creating walled silos. Moreover, this system works based on "trust", something that must be strengthened by, among other things, audits by external parties such as an accountant. The information age seems to be asking for a call for more transparency, and regulators are trying to meet this. Recently, in the Netherlands, regulators have decided that it is time to act harshly towards the auditors of these ledgers because the quality of audits is under the desired level ([Dutch article]( https://www.accountant.nl/nieuws/2020/1/nba-cta-rapport-is-scherpe-analyse-van-de-sector/)).

The question is: isn't it about time to set up a new system with more integrated preventive transparency?
