# BC-2 Blockchain Basics Course Introduction Level 2
 
## An introduction
This level continues on the high-level overview from level 1 in the first few weeks. First, we dive into some of the essential technicalities. Then, it gradually brings you to speed on the most critical topics, the very basics, which are often the same in the different types of blockchains. After this level, you will have a decent understanding and hands-on experience with these basics. Finally, you will be ready to choose your future specialization in level 3. 



## What exactly will we do then during this level?

## This chapter compared to a ball game

BC-2.1 Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) = “different games = different blockchains”
BC-2.2 Introducing the field: multi-disciplinary crypto flower = “describing the playing field”
BC-2.3 Introducing different overviews / point of views 	= “the different positions in the field”
BC-2.4 Different entities in the ecosystem = “the players in the game”
BC-2.5 Hard- and software tools = “the gear the players use”
BC-2.6 Introduction of transaction registration = “the ball that moves in the field”
BC-2.7 Ecosystems & Commons = “Goal of the game”
BC-2.8 Recap


This chapter is all about “putting the fundamentals together” and you will have a decent understanding of blockchain technology after this level + how to start the game yourself. You are then ready to pick your specialisation for the deep dive in level 3 (= for the 30 ECT students).
