# BC-2.7.8 Network effects

To create a well-working ecosystem of different independent entities, co-working to a shared goal and fulfilling their individual goals is not easy. Important in this design is that you design it so that you incorporate the effects of the [network effects]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect).

Network effects are essential for the adoption and survival of new technology. An example would be the telephone. If nobody has a phone, the value of the phone and the phone network drop significantly. But the more people have a phone, the more valuable the phone itself and the phone network become.


But how do we measure network effects, and with what criteria? Weâ€™ll paraphrase, revise and summarize the various criteria as follows from this [Source]( http://startupmanagement.org/2015/01/04/its-too-early-to-judge-network-effects-in-bitcoin-and-the-blockchain/):

Size: Must be large and have a scale (relative to the problem set or target community).
Inter-connectivity: Must exist between groups or systems inside the network (an essential requirement).
Engaged users: A good percentage of overall active users (about 30%) often come back to use the service, at least daily, if not weekly.
User experience: Must be unique, original, and enable new value creation while users are on the service.
Network effects: The value of the service increases for each user, as others use it or join it, and that value is propagated on the same network that was created.
Defensibility: Barriers to entry are gradually erected and strengthened by growing the service. At the same time, it gets more valuable with each new user, also resulting in high switching costs.
Monetization: As the network matures, one or several atomic value units emerge and become the basis for sustainable economic activity.

>ðŸ’¡ One of the goals of a token is to capture this network effect. How to move up from one user to a billion users.

It might be too early to draw decent conclusions. Still, it isnâ€™t that far fetched that the capability of tokenizing value will have an enormous effect on how we catch this network effect (digital and digital representative of offline values). The combination of reduced costs, higher value capture by participants, and the powerful growth incentives that well-designed tokenized networks provide create the conditions necessary to supplant some of todayâ€™s most influential companies.

As you can imagine, the world of game theory, network effects, and tokenization is an entirely new world on its own. We would love to invite you to explore this realm with us at the next Economic Level. If you are more interested in the Tech part and building dApps, we are waiting for you at the next Technical Level. Before we see you all there, a final high-level recap where we put levels 1 and 2 together and create your new level of understanding of how blockchains work. We will wait for you in the next level.

See you there ðŸ˜Š!
