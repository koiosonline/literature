# BC-2.5.2 Wallets 

In short: the game of blockchain is played with as many keys as you like. Wallets offer the service of keeping your keys together and ordering them. A wallet is a software tool that holds all your public addresses. Sometimes it stores your private key as well. You can use it to send cryptocurrencies and manage your keys. An example is MetaMask, the online wallet you use during the Koios courses to receive cryptocurrencies. 

Digital keys and digital signatures establish ownership. These keys are generated locally on the computer of a user. The keys can be stored in a file, in a database, or just printed on a piece of paper. The keys within each user's wallet allow the user to sign transactions, thereby providing cryptographic proof of the ownership of the cryptocurrency sourced by the transaction. 

The management is of the utmost importance. If you lose them, you lose access to your wallet. You can store them via an intermediary, such as exchanges. But intermediaries hold your key, and they can be hacked. An infamous [hack]( https://blockonomi.com/mt-gox-hack/) happened in 2014, where the exchange MtGox lost **740,000 bitcoins**. 

>ðŸ’¡ There is a famous saying in crypto. "Not your keys, not your bitcoin", from Andreas Antonopoulos (who else ðŸ˜Š) 

Like email addresses, Bitcoin addresses can be shared with other Bitcoin users who can use them to send bitcoins directly to your wallet. However, unlike email addresses, you can create new addresses as often as you like, all of which will direct funds to your wallet. A wallet is simply a collection of addresses and the keys that unlock the funds within. Therefore, there is practically no limit to the number of addresses a user can create.

There are a multitude of wallets out there, to be based on different preferences or scenarios. **Pick your wallet very carefully!** We will discuss all the different types in level 3, where they are mainly categorized in hot wallets (created online) and cold wallets (made offline, stored away from the internet).
