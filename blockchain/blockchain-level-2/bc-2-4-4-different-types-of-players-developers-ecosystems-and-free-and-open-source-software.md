# BC-2.4.4 Different types of players: Developers, Ecosystems and FOSS

Different layers (remember the “positions” in the field) ask for different kinds of developers. There are for example the front end developers, working on the user side of the application, and the back end developers, working on the infrastructure as for example the Bitcoin core developers working on the bitcoin protocol (software rules).

The open source principles allows developers from all over the world to not only contribute to the network, but also to “fork” the network and create a different approach (for example tweek one of the properties, like increasing the block size). We saw this happening in Linux, creating different operating systems with different properties for different use cases and is also already happening in the [blockchain realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bitcoin_forks).

## Free and Open Source (FOSS) Principles

FOSS enables you to build upon the shoulders of giants. Because nobody knows as much as everybody.
