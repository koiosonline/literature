## Introducing the commons

So who, or better said, what are the [commons]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-ReferenceA-1)?

1. The commons are the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately.
2. Commons can also be understood as natural resources that people (communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves various informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism.
3. Commons can also be defined as a social practice of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-govern the resource through institutions it creates.


Each stakeholder has an equal interest.

## Examples of commons

Environmental resource (air example)


Cultural and intellectual commons


Digital commons (Wikipedia & FOSS)


Urban commons


Knowledge commons



These resources may be part of the natural world (e.g., forests, climate systems, or the oceans), or they may be created (e.g., infrastructures such as irrigation systems, the internet or (scientific) knowledge, for example of the sort that is published in open-access journals). For detailed examples per category, see previous Wikipedia [sources]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-ReferenceA-1). Another interesting example of a digital common is [Linux]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE&feature=youtu.be). Or, in the blockchain realm, the DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization. The DAO as a common: self-sovereign entities generating “value”. It could be generating clean air, but also actual “money”.

As you might experience yourself already, it is not always clear when something is common. So we need to understand these institutions better. Many initiatives, [like the commons journal]( http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/), exist to help in that regard. Or the [IASC]( https://iasc-commons.org/ is the international Association for the Study of the Commons.

However, we still have a very long way to experience and understand the things we share beyond the enclosed spaces of private and public property. An excellent place to start to understand if something is a common or a public good:

Does this particular resource require management as a social mandate (= public good), or is it an expression of social mutuality and collaboration (= common)?

In other words, is this property best maintained by the government (= public good) or the public (= common)?

Note: a public good is therefore not a fully public good owned by the public. Often some form of centralized governance is in control, and remember the three main risk categories of centralized power…? This is a helpful starting place, yet it raises further questions.

## Food for thought

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac">❓ Who is responsible for the internet or clean air? Is it all of us? Is the G20? Is it the corporations? Or is it us, the public? </blockquote>

So far, we opt-in for the more centralized versions, but how is that working out? From the previously mentioned source: “Over the past few decades, the intergovernmental system has proclaimed its capacity to meet the needs of the world’s population and the environment through global public goods. However, this concept – a hybrid of Keynesian internationalism and corporate/financial neoliberalism – illustrates the lack of understanding and vision in the present management of the global commons.”

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac">❓ In more simple terms, ask yourself: where do you see us heading regarding our commons (natural like water & air or, for example, the digital commons like the internet?
</blockquote>
