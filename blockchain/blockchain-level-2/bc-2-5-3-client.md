# BC-2.5.3 Client 

In short: the client, also known as client software, lets the wallet communicate with the network. In other words: it connects the wallet that holds your keys with the miners that record your transactions. 

Side note: this also enables us to participate without becoming a full node (we rely on the client software of the wallet to connect to the SSOT).
