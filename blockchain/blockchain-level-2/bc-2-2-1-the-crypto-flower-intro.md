# BC-2.2.1 The crypto flower intro

>💡 If you want to move a blockchain within the scalability triangle of decentralization, speed, and security, you can do so by tweaking the properties of the protocol.

>💡 Where the use-case is an ultimate goal, the "why" we are doing this, the capabilities of the blockchain represented in the scalability triangle are the "how".


## The blockchain spectrum
 
We are still missing according to the "what", which describes a high-level overview of what realms we are playing. Just compare this session to us lecturing about sports, where we will describe different parts that pop up when you talk about sports. In sports, we have topics from nature (gravity, aerodynamics, and such), entertainments (televised, amateurs), type of field materials (grass, in-door, etc.), rules, etc. In short: when explaining sports (and blockchains!!), there are many different topics that we need to categorize.

And that is what this crypto-flower does. The crypto flower presents a categorized overview of the different fields we are active in. **It provides an overview of the area, the blockchain spectrum**. Each topic in this multidisciplinary field is a property. As a clog in the network when you relate it to the how and why. And just as clogs in the machine, each topic plays its essential role.

Just as with sports, there are many different blockchain clogs/topics. They are currently combined in four main categories and presented in the "blockchain spectrum" overview. It is based on the [money flower]( https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1709z.htm), created by the [Bank of International Settlements]( https://www.bis.org/), the “[mother & father” of all centralised banks]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements)”.  

This version is created by an engaged participant from within the ecosystem [via Twitter]( https://twitter.com/TaylorPearsonMe/status/923998769045127168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E923998769045127168%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Funchained-capital.com%2Fblog%2Fblockchain-spectrum%2F), we see that different colors represent each category. This is because each represents a separate leaf.

## Multi-disciplinary as promised

We have four different leaves, each with its topics:
1. Distributed systems
2. Cryptography
3. Politics
4. Economics

Each leaf contains its very own properties/topics that relate to that particular leaf. These main categories offer a way more significant scale than is displayed. Still, this representation does provide a decent overview and shows the multi-disciplinary character of blockchain technology.

Because all these leaves intersect with each other, Blockchain technology sits across the intersection where all four leaves cross in one place. This means that blockchain technology harbors components of all these leaves.

## 1. Distributed systems

Let's zoom in a bit on the different properties that each leaf encompasses. The first one up is (1) distributed systems. If we zoom in a bit, we encounter scaling, the BGP, and elections, for example, so, therefore, this leaf is sometimes also presented in overviews as the "consensus"-leaf. Based on these three selected topics, like the BGP, for example, you can see a clear connection with the other leaves. Just remember how Satoshi solved the BGP (using cryptography leaf 2, game economics in mining leaf three, and rearranging governance leaf 4). The topic BGP, in this case, is a stand-alone topic and remains in the realm of distributed systems. It only comes together with other domains (leaves) in the realm of blockchains.

## 2. Cryptography
The cryptography leaf is often named the same in other overviews. As we can see, it harbors topics like public and private key pairs, hash functions, and Merkle trees. All subjects, just like the BGP, that existed for decades in computer science and are fields on their own. But in blockchain space, they too interconnect with other topics, like the BGP (hashing to solve the PoW puzzle that enables a BGP workaround = combination of all four leaves, based on a hash function).

## 3. Governance
Leaf 3, named politics here, is also often referred to as [governance]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance). Governance comprises all of the governing processes, in blockchain's case: how do we deal with upgrades of the protocol, for example. This also offers me the chance to emphasize something when talking about this crypto flower. It merely contains the properties of blockchains but also only focuses on the blockchain itself. So when we talk about governance, we mean "on-chain", so the governance within the blockchain. We ignore the (huge) impact of blockchain technology on governance in the outside world. So the crypto flower is an inbound model and focuses on properties within the blockchain and not on the impact blockchains have on the outside world.

## 4. Economics
The last one is economics, sometimes referred to as the more narrow term "Game Theory" (economics is broader than that). Here we encounter topics like supply and demand that resulted in, for example, the hard-capped 21 million bitcoins in the Bitcoin infrastructure. In the blockchain realm, we experience this component in token economics, a.k.a. tokenomics. Cryptonomics handles questions such as: "How do we (dis)encourage actors in the ecosystem to contribute to the goal of the infrastructure?" and "How to build a sustainable decentralized model?".

## The blockchain expert
All leaves are equally important, and as mentioned in the first class: this makes blockchain technology so incredibly multi-disciplinary. Even if you are an expert in one field, you still don't understand the full impact of blockchain technology because you might miss critical insights in other areas. Therefore something like a "blockchain expert" is quite a claim because you would need to master all of these different fields to be an all-around expert. It usually takes a lifetime to master one of the topics within an area, for example, master the hash function, let alone the entire leaf (master cryptography). So it would be related to our sports example, like claiming to be an expert in sports (a vague and multi-interpretable term).

You can specialize in a leaf, though, and I'd suggest you pick out a leaf that suits your skills. Still, important: if you genuinely want to understand blockchain technology, mastering one leaf doesn't give you a free pass to ignore all the other leaves. You will need to do your due diligence (which, I promise, will provide you with new insights into your leaf/specialism).

Combining all these disciplines demanded a great vision, hence my compliments for Satoshi Nakamoto for combining all of these fields. This doesn't mean, and most likely isn't the case, that Satoshi was a cryptographic or economic mastermind. Instead, Satoshi "just" saw the connection and synergy between these fields. It might seem simple to lift on the success of others (enabled by the internet!) and connect some of these fields in a new experiment, but an incredible accomplishment that might change the course of humanity.

## Tweaking the properties within a leaf

Don't understand the importance of each property and its impact on a blockchain? Let's use a sports example: imagine if you switch from indoor to outdoor with sports. How would that impact all the other elements like aerodynamics, speed, etc.? But also: what would it do to that sport. It could even become an entirely different sport with different strategies.

To stick with blockchains: imagine tweaking the property "supply and demand" from the economic leaf. So let's say instead of the limited 21.000.000 bitcoins, we change it into an unlimited supply. This would impact the incentives and entire ecosystem: prices would drop (more supply), miners might leave, and eventually, the use-case could change. For example, the Store of Value use case will take a big hit if we have an unlimited supply. Another example: imagine if we rearrange the governance of Bitcoin 🡪 we appoint an organization that determines upgrades?

>💡 Each property has a significant role because not only is it vital on itself, it is interconnected and influences many other properties (like a domino game). That is why different testing solutions are so important: you often don't oversee all the implications of a decision.

But how exactly do we move a blockchain through the capabilities triangle by tweaking these properties? Let's say I am a core developer working on my very own blockchain. I use the Bitcoin protocol as my standard and start building from there. First, I need to determine the use case of my blockchain. So, where am I going to use it? Imagine I'd like to have better scalability properties, and I deem it wise to increase the block size from 1MB to 100 MB per block. All the other properties remain the same. I now can record more transactions per 10 minutes. Congratulations! You have just figured out how to build a blockchain that can handle more transactions per second. Let's say the entire ecosystem thinks it is a great idea, and everybody would join and switch from 1MB to 100 MB.

**We now have bigger blocks per 10 minutes, yeeaaah! But what did we sacrifice to accomplish this? We tweaked a property, so there is a chance that we moved in the scaling trilemma.**

In this case, bigger blocks mean bigger storage. So, you would need more storage space from your nodes, making being a node more costly. It also costs more bandwidth to send and receive blocks (more data). In this case, your blocks offer more scale but will cost you decentralization (fewer nodes). Just as the change from indoor to outdoor in sports changes the game entirely, the change in blockchain topics equally changes the game. And just as in sports, where not every change equally impacts the why of the end game (minor change in rules versus indoor to outdoor), neither does every change of property have an equal impact. But it does change the game! For the better? That is up to those that are active in the ecosystem.

The beauty of open blockchains: we can create our games, and everybody can come and play. Fun fact: the block size debate still is a hot item in the Bitcoin community and once actually led to a fork of Bitcoin in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. [Emotions went high]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCOjCEth6xI), people and groups verbally fighting, splitting resources, and everybody believing they are right.


## Conclusion
There are many ways to scale ledgers by changing properties, but realize that you make sacrifices along the way / you move to another spot in the scalability triangle. If you move to another spot = you move to another fit for another use case. Choose wisely 😉!
