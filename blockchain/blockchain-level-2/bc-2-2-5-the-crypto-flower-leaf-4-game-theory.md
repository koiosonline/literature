# BC-2.2.5 The crypto flower leaf 4: Game-theory


## Internal and External game theory 
You can split the game theory leaf into two similar components: internal and external game theory ("economics", called by some). 

> üí° When we talk about **internal game theory** for internal economics, we talk about crypto-economics (token economics / token engineering). And when we talk about **external game theory**, we talk about institutional crypto-economics. Institutional crypto-economics is how the blockchain influences the economics of the outside world. 

So, crypto-economics (ditch the institutional) is incentives & disincentives within a protocol. Institutional / external is outside the blockchain (impact on society). [Institutional crypto economics]( https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3157421) is about the impact of the new ledger on society. New societal structures and routes made possible by this new ledger and upgrade in recording transactions automatically. The [crypto economics]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKqdjaH1dRo) is about those game theories that apply to the blockchain itself. Think (dis)incentives: reward good behavior and punish bad behavior. 

## Token economics 

But when talking about crypto-economics (internal): what is good and what is bad behavior? That's up to the use case, but the beauty of an open ledger is that you can build on your own. At Koios, we use the Titan token (running on Ethereum). Still, we are experimenting with all different kinds of tokens and incentives. In our case, the aim is to build an educational ecosystem to incentivize all types of learning and sharing. As you will see in the final part of this level, building ecosystems for the commons and token economics is quite some challenge! 

We must keep focusing on the problems we aim to solve and try to move actors to behave so that we solve this problem. More about token economics and token economies in [this clip]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XatEoU36U-o&feature=emb_logo). 
With tokenomics, we need to figure out how to motivate actors to solve the challenge with us. For example, how do we incentivize all the ecosystem entities to show proper behavior, where proper = contributing to the end goal? 

## High-level steps & examples 
So, first of all, you need to know what all the entities are. When creating an educational ecosystem, we need to know the entities (students, teachers, uni's, partners). And perhaps more importantly, what do they want? How could we send them in a particular direction? So that they finally act according to our vision. But us making a decision is not a very healthy blockchain ecosystem. It is as much centralized as current systems come, and we are therefore experimenting with Koios as a DAO. An organizational form where users become owners and make decisions. So we need to design a token structure so that it encompasses all the needs of our entire ecosystem. There is no way that we know what our (global focussed) ecosystems want, let alone say ten years from now. That's why we keep integrating more decentralized components. The ecosystem will eventually decide what it would want to do (which might differ per region). 

A more straightforward example of alignment with the goal of the blockchain by using the native cryptocurrency is the use-case of bitcoin on Bitcoin. The problem Satoshi encountered was: how will I incentivize as many people as possible to do the work currently done by TTP. So how do we offer validation and security? Because of the immutability, we also offer finality. So no reruns with wrong transfers, which would have been possible with TTP ü°™ "there is no Bitcoin helpdesk". 

So how do we incentivize security? As you know: the creation of new bitcoins per mined block. So we want the miners to chase the gold because they bring a lot of security, and we need protection. The end goal is secure, global money. What would happen if we muddle a bit with the token economics, so increase the amounts of bitcoin per block, uncap the supply, delay the average time per block, or increase the quantities of Satoshis? Etc. You see that these minor tweaks within these economic fundamentals will most likely change the (dis)incentives. Sound token engineering is therefore essential for the creation and survival of an ecosystem! Because in the end, we are merely talking about a tool. A tool used by humans and machines and autonomous organizations, etc. But humans should eventually become the benefactors. Human behavior and steering them towards the goal will determine the success or failure of your blockchain ecosystem.


So now you know the field a bit and understand the four main categories and some of the most important topics within those categories. You made a big step and enjoyed it! Next, the different positions within the field of blockchain technology in 2.3!

**Bottom line: don't forget the human role in technology!**

## Conclusion 

**Two types of "cryptoeconomics"**
**Institutional cryptoeconomics** is the study of how changes in ledger technology aÔ¨Äect economic activity via its eÔ¨Äect on institutions, organization, governance, and transactions costs. Institutional crypto-economics seeks to understand how an economy that is extensively based on distributed ledger technology diÔ¨Äers in fundamental and systematic ways from an economy based on centralized ledger technology. 
**Cryptoeconomics**: Institutional cryptoeconomics should be distinguished from cryptoeconomics. Cryptoeconomics is the more speciÔ¨Åc concern with applying microeconomic theory (particularly game theory and mechanism design) to the eÔ¨Écient design of incentives for blockchain consensus protocols. 

**Game Theory (in later classes way more info!)**
Mechanism design & Game theory are essential concepts. They need to be well incorporated in a network to scale at large and incentivize the users fully. Like miners in Bitcoin and Ethereum are motivated to mine for BTC or ETH (PoW) or community members stake funds to validate (PoS). Token design in crypto projects is **often underestimated** or not very well designed. Sometimes even neglected on purpose for making a quick buck (so-called "scam coins") 

**The goal:** Incentivizing ecosystems to stimulate behavior (aligned with goals) and de-stimulate unwished behavior (prevent unwished behavior). Its aim is eÔ¨Écient design of incentives for blockchain consensus protocols and incentivizing‚Ä¶**to eventually create an entire ecosystem collectively working towards one goal, while simultaneously working for their motives (!)**


Economics has often been seen as a dismal science. It has always been seen as a rather abstract matter or discipline. However, economics is a social science that studies human interaction in a broad sense and can offer some unique insights that are often overlooked. Blockchain is a case in point. Primarily discussed from a technical and legal standpoint, the economics of blockchain and the economics that explain why the technology is so important and revolutionary are often overlooked.

Although no one accepts a simple definition, one can safely say that economics is a science that studies human behavior and interaction as a relationship between ends and scarce means with alternative uses. In other words, it explores the concepts of choice and decision-making, the coordination process, and the allocation of resources. Possibly, a simplistic view of economics is that it studies markets.

The market image encapsulates many economic elements, including the allocation of resources; the mechanisms of individual choice, the actual transactions; the payment and settlement of a transaction; the exchange between the buyers and sellers, and so much more. The market embodies the spirit of transactions and includes transfer, settlement, and even more so of trust. Trust is a cornerstone of economics and political economy. Economics studies how trust is built through repeated interactions apart from the rules or institutions that should support this function.

**Bottom line: don't forget the human role in technology!**
