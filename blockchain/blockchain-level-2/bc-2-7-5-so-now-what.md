# BC-2.7.5 So now what?

The blockchain community will keep on building for obvious reasons. Not only because they can, or they aim to improve failing structures, but as you know now also because they are incentivized in multiple ways to do so (financially as well by holding parts of the cryptocurrencies of the protocol that they are building).

But how does the rest of society adapts?

The blockchain applications are already finding their way to the users, so this seems to be a "from the bottom-up" movement, reforming societies institutes. Hard to stop by current institutes. This is not only because of a lack of knowledge but also because of limitations in jurisdictions and, perhaps most importantly, different incentives and belief systems.

The world seems to be on the tipping point, heading to create a new global social contract. It could be protocol-based like Bitcoin or Ethereum and based on the application layer with open public smart contracts. New social contracts, with global reach. For legitimate firms of commons democracy to be rooted in and distributed across all political communities, a significant reconfiguration of socio-economic relations, rules and institutions are needed. This takes time, not only for users to adjust to new applications but also for institutions. They may even remain a use case for the former institution or infrastructure. Horses are still on our roads in some cases.


To take it up a notch (from the [previous used source about common goods]( http://wealthofthecommons.org/essay/why-distinguish-common-goods-public-goods):

The people's contract for global citizenship will empower resource communities and civil society organizations to create trusteeships, which include but transcend parliamentary forms of governance, giving them a democratic means for voicing local claims to self-determination outside the state system. By this means, a national sovereign authority may be renegotiated in terms of commons resource areas and bioregions. Resource users and producers/providers would then make direct decisions on all common properties of significance, holding and managing them for future and current generations and species. Since every resource domain is unique and so many commons overlap, common management would be deliberated through local, state, interstate, regional, and global stakeholder discussions. In this way, democratic commons institutions would operate at every level of governance independently while overlapping simultaneously.

The development of global governance is an enormous challenge. First, the basis of the sovereign state must be entirely reformulated. By agreeing to a new foundation for common goods in social and economic laws and institutions, the state will have to reduce the dominant role of private goods and recognize the moral and political legitimacy of people's rights to preserve, access, produce, manage and use their resources. This means developing a new epistemology of resource sovereignty, shared responsibility, and legal accountability that recognizes the rights of world citizens to their commons. When the self-organized and participatory systems of common property, social charters, and commons trusts are infused into global constitutional governance, the checks and balances within many nations will find a perfect expression in the representative decision-making and political equality democratic commons institutions. Thus, the new global economic system and its social contract will be grounded, not incorporating claims or state sovereignty, but in the sovereign rights of citizens to their common goods.

This might happen sooner than you think. Just remember: "sci-fi today is reality tomorrow" (with a bit of optimistic thinking ðŸ˜‰). People and communities are experimenting with [decentralized nations]( https://steemit.com/governance/@cc-billboard/decentralized-nations-are-they-the-future) like [Bitnation Pangea]( https://tse.bitnation.co/) and many, many more.

You can build your decentralized nation. Of course, a long way before we are there, nor are we the first generation to [imagine these concepts]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOgFZfRVaww)
