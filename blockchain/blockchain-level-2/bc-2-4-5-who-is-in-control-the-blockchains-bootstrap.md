# BC-2.4.5 Who is in control? The blockchains bootstrap

You understand that there are different fields, positions in that field, who determines the rules and who the referee is, and what other players are active in the game. But who is in charge of the game, who can play the boss? Welcome to the "Blockchain Power Bootstrap"

## Who is in control?
This session will tell you all about the blockchain bootstrap, how everybody is in control, and how nobody's in control. Also known as the **blockchain bootstrap**. It means that, indeed, everybody can impact the blockchain, but nobody can impact it. This is because it's a bootstrap, so individual elements/entities are connected, have their interests, and can't do without each other.

## The restaurant example

 [Antonopoulos]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpeceXY1QBM&feature=emb_logo) uses an excellent example to explain this. He uses the restaurant example. Imagine that a blockchain is a restaurant where we, as users, can eat (transacting). When we enter this restaurant, we are not alone. Some cooks cook and use machinery (miners). We are ordering from a menu written by developers in this case. And after we are done, we need to pay people with money (exchanges). Big investors have paid for the building that we're eating. And we've got some people yelling on the street, promoting their blockchains and ecosystem.

>ðŸ’¡ The essence of the bootstrap is the following: we all play our role in an ecosystem. Without one of the entities, the ecosystem won't succeed. The picture below perhaps says it all. We can't do without each other and monitor each other's behavior.

Try to run a restaurant without somebody writing the menu, taking orders, checking payments, cooking, etc. Everybody, in this case, has some form of power and control: A developer can change the menu. The cook can decide whether to cook the menu. You have the power to order from the menu. Of course, if nobody is out there pronouncing how fantastic this restaurant is, nobody will find your restaurant. You need all of them! And the beauty here is in the design that as soon as somebody starts acting out, everybody will see it instantly (transparent system). So as soon as the cooks start cooking meat on the menu while you are in a vegetarian restaurant (abuse protocol), everybody will see and might say, "Hey, that's not a very good vegetarian restaurant. I will stop eating there". Our developers will build it in such a design that you can't even order meat from the menu, so they can't validate the transaction. And it works the other way around as well. Let's say that suddenly developers got some ideas in their head, and let's say, "why not create bigger blocks" = why not add meat to the menu (change protocol). Miners can initially say perfectly fine, but I won't validate those blocks, or nodes won't validate those blocks. Even if miners cook meat, the users might think, "I'm not seriously thinking about eating meat. I'm still vegetarian. I think 2MB might be a bad idea so that I won't go to the 2MB restaurant." And here kicks in the bottom line:

>ðŸ’¡ Nobody is in control because everybody is in control.

And you as a user can pick your restaurant based on your preferences! Do you want to have sound international money that's a bit slower but faster than the current monetary system? Pick the Bitcoin blockchain. If you wish to quickly centralize trust money, you'll use the fiat money system (if available to you). If you want to play and develop some things, you go to an entirely different restaurant. It's the same thing whether you're ordering some beef menu or drinking a soupâ€”other meals, different use cases. For now, that's enough :-)
## If you want to understand forking
We will use this restaurant example more often in the future to explain how you can innovate blockchains with something called forkology ;-) Go ahead and watch the video in the further readings! We will wait for you in the next session ðŸ˜Š

## Portfolio assignment

Make yourself a YouTube video of up to 5-10 minutes in which you explain how mining works and where you make a distinction between PoW mining and PoS minting. Include the link to the video in your portfolio.
