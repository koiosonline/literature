# BC-2.4.3 Different types of players: nodes / validators



** We suggest you watch the video with this transcript as well**

This is a Raspberry Pi 4. It is a mini-computer, which in our case acts as a node. You perhaps recognize parts of it from this other side. This mini-computer has a hard drive where you can run an operating system like Windows or Linux.

## The steps to set up a node
Set up the hardware device of choice. It could also be your PC. What we do is we connect an internet cable to the LAN cable. We link the USB ports for my keyboards, my screen to the HDMI port. And we've got a storage space below in which we entered a TB hard drive.
Download the software from bitcoin.org. The initial block download will take approximately three to seven working days if you have a fast computer and internet three days but roughly a week on average. Our role as a node is guarding the protocol. We are validating miners who present their blocks to nodes spread across the globe. Here at The Hague University, we have a few nodes running. But this can also be done from home. The nodes are spread across the globe as you can see on [coin dance]( https://coin.dance/nodes/abc).

## About the spread of nodes
You see here that there's a lot of concentration in the Western and big Asian known countries. This, of course, seems logical because these countries are currently innovating. The problem with this is that other parts of the world are left behind. Large parts of South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia have no nodes. The problem might be that this is the new economic infrastructure being built, but once again in an unequal way of distribution. Of course, still accessible for all via the internet but lacking in infrastructure, knowledge, and skill.

This is one of the main reasons why we're offering education in a fully open-source environment: we want to spread all these dots equally distributed across the globe. We need the other parts of the world to join for several reasons (unfair wealth distribution, skills, knowledge, and another approach/vision/culture). So far, the tech is not there yetâ€”something like this raspberry pie four costs approximately 90 EUR ($100). Older versions are about $30. Don't forget the internet bandwidth and the energy it costs to keep it updated. It's perfectly fine to do this within a university, but a lot of time, energy, and money for individuals.

An improvement could be the equal distribution of nodes. Other protocols, like [Mina Protocol]( https://minaprotocol.com/), are experimenting with this vision. In addition, the use of new tech, like ZK-snarks in Mina's case, may lead to a new use case. So far, it doesn't look like Bitcoin nodes will spread across the less developed parts, but who knows what the future holds? Perhaps run a node on your phone?
