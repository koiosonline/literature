# BC-2.8 Putting it all together: how do blockchains work?


## So what do we already know

Step 1: A public key represents the entity, this can be a human, department, organization, but for the first time in human history, value can now also be sent by a piece of code called a contract enabling, for example, machines owning public keys (you can create an automated organization without human interfering). The entity constructs a transaction (for example, collecting UTXO's and bundles them in one transaction). Then, it adds the public key of the recipient and their private key called the digital signature.

Step 2: the constructed transaction is now cryptographically secured (remember the color blending?) and is offered to the network by the client software that talks to the wallet containing the keys and the network where the miners are waiting for transactions.

All the transactions worldwide are gathered (in the "mempool" = as "unconfirmed"). Then, each miner picks the transactions and collects them until the block is "full" (determined by the consensus rules).

Then, the miner checks the transactions. Are these transactions valid?


Miner solves the PoW puzzle or is, for example, randomly selected by an algorithm (PoS) and presents the valid block to the entire network (all the nodes). Each node validates the proposed block and, if valid (= checks if the miner abides by the protocol rules?), adds the block to their blockchain and compares the hash with other nodes. Thus, if everybody has the same data, every node should have the same hash. Therefore everyone has the same "single source of truth."

We now not only have (1) a decentralized ledger, but it also enables (2) automated transactions—a new form of the ledger, respectively, a new form of data recording. Most likely resulting in new forms of society. A shared global truth with no trusted third party, entering a new era of ledger technology. Leading technologists believe that the implications of this technological breakthrough will be far-reaching, extending far beyond digital currency. Imagine a public and immutable ledger spread across the globe, open to all, and lets you record digital data. Blockchain harbors a possible promise to distribute power from central entities to the commons and cut out the middleman.

**Think trustless, think privacy, think self–sovereignty, and own data in a data-driven world.**

## Morpheus


A final message from Morpheus:

*This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.*

## Portfolio assignment 2-8-1



1. Create your own tradeable token

2. Create your own non-fungible token. Where, how, what is all up to you. Suprise us :-)


3. Prove that you can:
1.Describe the concept of “commons” and the “tragedy of the commons” in my own words
2. Describe in my own words what is meant with “an ecosystem” and how they relate to blockchain
3. Explain the role of tokens in an blockchain based ecosystem
4. Create a common based goal for a blockchain based network
5. Create a strategy to set up an ecosystem which could work towards a common based goal.
