# BC-2.5.1 Introducing the tools

## About this chapter?

In this chapter, we havenâ€™t recorded videos, but we used good old-fashioned reading. It is a high-level overview of the tools users can use to play the game. Of course, different users can use various tools.

*We will provide a more detailed explanation per tool in level 3.*
 
## What will we discuss?
BC-2.5.1     Your public-private key pair

BC-2.5.2     Wallets
