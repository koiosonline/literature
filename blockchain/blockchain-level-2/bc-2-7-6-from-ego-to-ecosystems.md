# BC-2.7.6 From ego- to ecosystems

Hence the challenge of our generation to move from ego-orientated systems. A select group of entities getting more powerful versus ecosystem-orientated systems. First signs are already slightly visible, from the [masses]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement) to the more [theoretical parts of society]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century).

## Ecosystems

Okay….but wait a sec? What was an ecosystem again?! In short: we have multiple forms of ecosystems, in general, [natural ecosystems]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem) and [digital ecosystems]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_ecosystem). Since we are talking about digital realms here, let’s refrain from diving into natural ecosystems. These natural ecosystems are the very basics of digital ecosystems, though:
“A digital ecosystem is a distributed, adaptive, open socio-technical system with properties of self-organization, scalability, and sustainability inspired from natural ecosystems. Digital ecosystem models are informed by knowledge of natural ecosystems, especially for aspects related to competition and collaboration among diverse entities.”

The topics of ecosystems and how to create and manage them are essential questions to ask when we talk about solving common related problems. In the next level, we will zoom in on these ecosystem-related topics and how to design them.

A great start is [this research]( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323916602_Towards_a_Theory_of_Ecosystems) that offers a “theory of ecosystems” that can explain what they are when they emerge and why alignment occurs. It also outlines the critical factors affecting ecosystem emergence, evolution, and success ‐‐ or failure”. Applied the picture above to a blockchain-based ecosystem, you might get a visual like this (high-level overview):
