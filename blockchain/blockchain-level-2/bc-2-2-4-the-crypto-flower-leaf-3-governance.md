## The crypto flower leaf 3: Governance




To give you an idea, each leaf includes decades of research and multiple different types of studies. So we are only showing you tiny parts of these leaves. To truly master the art, we suggest you pick a topic you like a start digging. Never forget the powerful synergetic effect when you use a multi-disciplinary approach and a broad open view. Several thousand, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of people have been working on these different types of subjects. So when we discuss the leaf Governance, we are merely showing you the very utmost tip of the iceberg. Don‚Äôt get discouraged, though. We will tackle most of the topics of each leaf that are relevant for blockchain technology.



## Definition 
So let‚Äôs start with the definition of [governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance).

>üí° There are two main categories of governance related to blockchain technology. Internal governance means being directly integrated into the blockchain and ecosystem itself. External governance is about the impact the blockchain has on its outer realm, the society, for example).


## Internal governance 
Examples of **internal governance**: how do we govern the processes regarding upgrades, how do we govern the ecosystem, how do we reach consensus, how do we arrange the processes in such a way that the goal of the blockchains is met (preferably without losing its integrity, because not always will the goal justifies the means). Internal governance impacts the internal components of the blockchain.

> Two forms of **internal**  blockchain governance*:

>üí°1. Governance regarding the recording of transactions and blocks: ‚Äúwhich transactions and which blocks are valid‚Äù (= **what** are the consensus/protocol rules!)

>üí°2. Governance regarding changes of the protocol: ‚Äúsoftware updates‚Äù (= **who** are allowed to make changes, **how** does the ecosystem upgrades the protocol)


## External governance

External governance can be recognized as introducing new forms of trust. It is about rearranging society. What can blockchain technology mean for the world outside its bits and bytes in an open ledger? For example, reinventing money, the internet, or organizations.

## It's all about governance! 

The importance of governance may not be lightly waved. If done incorrectly, it could lead to splits in the ecosystem. Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are good examples. In 2016 Ethereum ran a big project called the DAO-initiative, where A LOT of Ether was involved. As you might have guessed, there was an error in the chain of contracts (a reminder of how young this technology is), and Ether started leaking into the public key of a hacker. The community intervened and could prevent further damage. Still, a lot of damage was done, and very influential parties lost their Ether to the hacker. A vote was proposed to turn back transactions (= alter the story!) and start over from the block before the DAO started, ignore the DAO, and record once more the other regular transactions that were still valid. Not everybody agreed: this challenged the fundamental principles of an immutable ledger, + the hacker didn‚Äôt do anything wrong: they just exploited the available bug in open software (a grey area by my dummy legal estimation). Hence two stories rose: Ethereum Classic, where the classic blockchain, including the DAO, continued. Versus Ethereum, in which Vitalik Buterin and his team turned back the DAO transactions, returning lost money.

All fair and square, you would say, but of course, many bugs happen afterward. Loads of Ether were either hacked, contract oversight, or stuck and lost forever because (search for Parity multi-signature wallets and see what pops up). Each time rendering the question, can we turn back time? So far, it has only happened once, but you don‚Äôt know if it could happen again. Many voices mainly rose during the Parity incident. In short: somebody, somewhere (a team), makes a decision: we will propose rewinding the story/the clock or not. Not truly decentralized, but the beauty: all transparent. And thanks to forks, about which more later, you were given a choice as a user. Continue the current road or rewind time. Do note: coordinating would now be a lot harder because of the size and vested interests!


Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt do all that better in the governance department. 

An example: [The Latest Bitcoin Bug Was So Bad, Developers Kept Its Full Details a Secret]( https://www.coindesk.com/the-latest-bitcoin-bug-was-so-bad-developers-kept-its-full-details-a-secret). The bug was reported by an alert community member (anonymous). And although an excellent example of the power of an ecosystem, it is also a good example of centralized authorities at play in Bitcoin. A combination of core developers and miners consortia pushed through some updates fixing the bug and later on revealing what they had done. The valid question remains whether true decentralization exists, but more about that in a later deep dive in level 3.


Hopefully, you now have a basic understanding of what governance is (how to arrange all of the different processes so that the goal is met) and the utmost importance. Internally on the blockchain itself, because it can determine the future of the blockchain and its ecosystem. Externally, because it impacts the outside world by offering new forms of society. From centralized structures with power at the top to decentralized networks in the protocol between peers). From the ego system to the ecosystem.

## Blockchain Governance 101 ‚Äì a must-read
For now, a good starting point is to start with [this article]( https://blog.goodaudience.com/blockchain-governance-101-eea5201d7992) from Vlad Zamfir about blockchain governance 101. Then, a more general tip for those willing to put in the extra mileage: just read everything he has written, and you will gradually connect the dots.


## Conclusion

Two forms of **internal**  blockchain governance *:
Governance regarding the recording of transactions and blocks: ‚Äúwhich transactions and which blocks are valid‚Äù (= what are the consensus/protocol rules!)
Governance regarding changes of the protocol: ‚Äúsoftware updates‚Äù (= who are allowed to make changes, how does the ecosystem upgrades the protocol)
 
*Once again: different blockchains, different flavors!

We also have **external** blockchain governance:
What are the implications of a decentralized distributed ledger? As mentioned before: removing centralized TTP (1) and automated changes in the state of the ledger (2) can lead to new forms for societal governance! Think peer-to-peer transactions with more security, trustless without hierarchy, and a level playing field without thresholds in an open-source environment on a global level.
