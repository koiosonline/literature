# bc-2.7.2 The tragedy of the commons

[This short clip]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxC161GvMPc) + [this short clip]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs2P0wRod8U) explain the tragedy of the commons very well. 

The tragedy of the commons, in short, is the tendency of any resource that is unowned, and hence nonexcludable, to be overused and undermaintained. This is not a current-day problem and existed long before our generations. As Aristotle already mentioned 2400 years ago (!): ‚Äúwhat is common to the greatest number, gets the least amount of care‚Äù. The problem of our generations, though, is that our world is getting increasingly smaller and better interconnected because of new technologies. Hence, this amplifies and rapidly increases the speed at which we now need to solve this tragedy. 
So aren‚Äôt there any solutions to avoid the tragedy of the commons? Yes, but there is no single universal cure that will work in all conditions. 

There are currently three general groups: 
Command and control / Regulation (Hardin)
Creating property rights (Hardin)
Cultural norms / bottom-up institutions (Elstrom) 

The problem in current systems, where centralized parties still hold control, is something we previously encountered and called the [Coase Theorem]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00HPak2RLlQ&t=382s): the more parties required to agree, the more transaction costs, the less likely a deal is actually to happen. 

## Blockchain & Tragedies 
If only we had a technique that incorporates transparent rules (1), designed from bottom-up norms in open environments by peers (3) creating individual property rights of assets. See here the end game of blockchain technology: a tool to create a better infrastructure to enable solutions suited for the Tragedy of the Commons. Because of properties like increased transaction cost efficiency, transparency, immutability, decentralized ownership, and incorporated compliance, including third-party audits on each transaction, it offers a solution for the Coase Theorem (because transaction costs are low and property rights are clearly defined: ‚Äúif transaction costs are low and property rights are clearly defined, private bargains will ensure that the market equilibrium is efficient even if there are externalities. Thus, markets can be used to control externality problems‚Äù.

In addition, individual incentives are significant. Incentivizing individuals by transferring value between them (through cryptocurrencies) is one of the leading design elements of blockchain technology. Problems like the tragedy of the commons arise when the interest of the individual is not aligned with the general interests. This is something you can steer with token-design, as Satoshi has proven with proof-of-work mining where the interests of the individual miner (mining bitcoin) are in the interest of the ecosystem (validating transactions and adding security to the blockchain). More about this in the ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù & ‚Äúgame theory‚Äù part of this chapter üòä!
