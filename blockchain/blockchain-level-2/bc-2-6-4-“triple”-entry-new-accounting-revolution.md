# BC-2.6.4 "Triple" Entry (new accounting revolution?)


## The definition
Triple Entry is a new concept and definitions can therefore differ. In our case, we apply the concepts of sign and double-entry accounting. Still, we include third-party verification (miners) and automated recording (smart contracts).

## Bitcoin & Ethereum are different
>ðŸ’¡ Bitcoin uses transaction-based accounting: entering transactions like single entry accounting.

 

>ðŸ’¡ Ethereum looks more like double-entry accounting: entering account-based transactions


More about that later.

## Triple-entry accounting
So what's new?  **The recording of transactions is cryptographically secured.**
History can't be altered when recorded and verified across the globe. It is an append-only system. The advantage of append-only storage is that the database is "immutable". It keeps an entire history of all the transactions that have been done. Read more about it [here](https://redislabs.com/ebook/part-2-core-concepts/chapter-4-keeping-data-safe-and-ensuring-performance/4-1-persistence-options/4-1-2-append-only-file-persistence/).

Near-instant verification by multiple external parties, proving that the transaction happened,

The transactions contain data that can automatically execute itself / change its state (= no TTP or accountant needed, the so-called "smart contracts")

Resulting in a global ledger, sometimes automatically updating its state without using a TTP. You already know the benefits: it reduces the three risks of TTP. First, enabling us to record data, where data can take multiple forms like a regular bitcoin transaction, the representation of a real-world asset, but also enabling a smart contract. Second, how that data is used differs per blockchain.

Like the previously mentioned [article]( https://medium.com/@permabullnino/bitcoin-an-accounting-revolution-40efcb903d7b) about Bitcoin and accounting stated: Bitcoin is the first accounting system ever to provide *absolute assurance* over ledger data. Unlike double entry, Bitcoin provides* practical third-party verification* via its inflexible, highly redundant protocol + network. From an accounting perspective, the speed at which this verification from independent parties occurs is incredibly significant, as it reflects a paradigm shift from an overhead intensive and slow verification regime to one that is lightweight for users and only "a click away" at all times.
To put it more simply, it disintermediates the old and separate internal accounting + external audit functions by combining them into a single, inseparable product.

**To simplify**

usually, transactions within one closed-off ledger need to be audited by internal and external auditors to ensure they are trustworthy. The quality of data increases when different entities cross-referenced their data with yours. Different perspectives, but same result. So my administration states you owe me 10 euro, your ledgers should state you owe me 10 euro. The alignment of outstanding records with other parties' records is known as the "third party confirmation". You don't need this confirmation in an open ledger, like Ethereum or Bitcoin because every transaction is recorded in the same ledger (all the miners and nodes audit every valid transaction).

## Kings & Queens of the world

In your ledger, you can be a king or queen. You can create stuff out of the blue and do whatever you want. Suppose you are accountable because you are a company. In that case, you will have a specific set of rules you need to abide by, which is checked by auditors and your IRS. But still, you can (deliberately) make mistakes and misrepresent the ledger. Resulting in incorrect data and information. This only happens in closed-off environments where people can alter the data.

Bitcoin is an append-only ledger. You can only send or receive transactions. You can't change records other than sending transactions. As we explained, you can't alter the past.

>ðŸ’¡ Blockchains are append-only for users. You have **unique** data that only an owner of the public key can alter by sending the data forth.
In short: you can only pass the value along. You can't make copies of the data. You either keep it in your wallet or send it to another wallet. By sending Bitcoin to somebody or interacting with a smart contract, all will alter the data and create new unique data (where the old state is lost and can't be reproduced).

## Total recap accounting
We first had the single-Entry System, but a big downside was limited in accounting records (only profit & loss). It is equally vital that Error Checking is not automatically incorporated! Suppose the single-entry bookkeeper mistakenly enters a revenue inflow as $10,000 when the correct value is $1,000. In that case, the error may go unnoticed until the firm receives a bank statement with an unexpected low account balance. In a double-entry system, however, the $1,000 cash deposit entry (a debit to an asset account, cash on hand) will be accompanied by another entry recognizing the source, for example, a credit to a liability account (e.g., bank loan) or a credit to another asset account (accounts receivable). And, if the firm omits the second entry, the sums of credits and debits in the System would differ, immediately revealing the error.

Double Entry accounting to the rescue, with its integrated error checking. One "minor" problem remains: a trusted third party is involved with the power to alter the ledger and create fictional entries (also brings the three main risk categories as we discussed in level 1!). As we will show next is how Bitcoin solves this problem: by continually referring to the entire past of a transaction and, more importantly: fully sending those transactions (and its history) as unique data to a new owner and not just a part of the transaction.

>ðŸ’¡ Like the definition of computing transaction already stated in the very first source: a transaction is "a (1) single unit, (2) processed in totality or failed"! Verified by third parties, and we have triple entry accounting.
