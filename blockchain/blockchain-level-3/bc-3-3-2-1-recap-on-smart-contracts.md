# BC-3.3.2 Smart contracts

## About this chapter?
This is the deep dive on smart contracts, as much as possible described from an economic perspective, intermixed with some technical components. 

## What will we discuss? 

BC-3.3.2.1 Recap on Smart contracts

BC-3.3.2.2 How does a smart contract ticks & tocks?

BC-3.3.2.3 Examples of use cases

BC-3.3.2.4 Different smart contract platforms

BC-3.3.2.5 Smart contract life cycle

BC-3.3.2.6 The future of smart contracts

BC-3.3.2.7 Ricardian Contracts: a combination of wet & dry code

BC-3.3.2.8 Smart contracts on Bitcoin

BC-3.3.2.9 Bleeding edge technology

BC-3.3.2.10 Monetization smart contracts


## After this class, I can:


* Create my very own basic smart contract (create)

* Describe the smart contract life cycle (understand) 

* Evaluate the possible future of smart contracts and support my arguments by comparing the benefits and shortcomings of smart contracting (evaluate) 

* Explain how I can monetize smart contracts myself (understand) 

* Deploy my very own intermediate smart contract (create)

# BC-3.3.2.1 Recap on Smart contracts


## Origin 

[Coined and popularized by Nick Szabo in 1994](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html). The origin is disputed. 

## Early developments

[From Mastercoin to Ethereum]( https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html).

Easy to create and deploy uncensorable smart contracts into and people could now imagine, “transaction without intermediaries. The simple analogy evolved from a digital “vending machine” that is owned by one party (and could thus be taken down, i.e. Paypal) to one that is not owned by anyone, is unstoppable and still accessible to anyone in the world with an Internet connection.
Early ideas/examples were decentralized Uber and Airbnb (“web3”) as well as decentralized platforms for lending, derivatives and startup investing (“open finance”).

Ethereum smart contracts are (mostly) written in Solidity, relatively easy to read and understand, and Turing-complete so we can use them for general-purpose programming. 
With two most notable constraints being: difficulty to interact with the outside of the Ethereum network and paying for the execution of the code.

“It is not really smart and not really a contract”: a smart contract is a contractual agreement that is implemented using software. Unlike a traditional contract where parties may seek remedial action through the legal system, a smart contract is self-enforced (possibly also self- executed), depending on whether specific conditions, that are monitored through software, are met. 

 A smart contract isn’t a blockchain. It is a piece of code stored on a blockchain. A blockchain transaction triggers the execution of the contract. The blockchain’s database, then, is where the smart contract reads and writes data.
