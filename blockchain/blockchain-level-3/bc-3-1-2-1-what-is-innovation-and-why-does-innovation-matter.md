# BC-3.1.2.1 What is innovation, and why does innovation matter? 

Change is an accelerator for innovation, but what is innovation? Innovation is a particularly sticky problem because it so often remains undefined. We treat it as a monolith as if every innovation is the same and one approach fits all. That's why efforts tend to be fraught with buzzwords and rarely lead anywhere. 

## Innovation 
>ðŸ’¡ [Innovation]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation): the ability to see connections, spot opportunities, and take advantage of them. 

Because change alters relations and opens up new doors and possibilities, new opportunities arise. Technology often plays an essential role in enabling incremental or radical changes and create new opportunities. It can, for example, open up existing markets or create an entirely new market. An organization's ability to learn and translate that learning into action rapidly is the ultimate competitive business advantage. A few examples of opportunities caused by blockchain technology by innovating the educational sector can be found [here]( https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomvanderark/2018/08/20/26-ways-blockchain-will-transform-ok-may-improve-education/#78da61634ac9).

## Why does it matter?

Spotting opportunities can be very profitable for an organization or individuals but only matter at these levels. Therefore, it increasingly becomes part of Nationwide strategies to increase their wellspring and economic growth. Nowadays, even an index, the Global Innovation Index (GII), ranks countries in terms of their enabling environment to innovation. 

## Contributions 

Innovation contributes in several ways: 

* new product development 

* market performance (capturing and retaining market shares, increasing profitability, etc.). 

* strategic advantage, helping companies reduce costs, achieve economies of scale, and lockout competitors and new entrants.

Innovation is not to be confused with creativity, where creativity is thinking up new things. Instead, innovation is doing new things. Likewise, innovation is neither to be confused with the term invention. You can invent something great, but that doesn't mean that you instantly see the opportunities of your invention or, if you did: have the means & skills, network, grid, or experience to bring success to market and commercialize it (or take advantage in some other way). Therefore being a great inventor doesn't necessarily mean that you are a great innovator. Or the other way around: you could be a great innovator but a lousy innovator yourself. 

Suppose you take a closer look at the history of inventions. In that case, it is often not the names of the inventors we remember but the names of the persons who brought the inventions into commercial use globally. An exciting film that will elaborate on this fact is [Joy (2015)]( https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2446980/), which allows you a sneak preview of the different types of setbacks you can encounter when trying to extract value from your inventions. Sometimes, a famous inventor is also a great innovator. Take Thomas Edison, for example, who recorded over 1,000 patents. 

Just remember: Innovation is the process of turning opportunities into ideas and take advantage of those ideas (for example, turning these into commercial practice). So much brainpower goes into defining a problem, where you try to connect the dots and spot opportunities to solve your problems. Albert Einstein once said, "if I had 20 days to solve a problem, I would spend 19 days to define it." That sounds like some solid advice ðŸ˜‰!

## Categorizing innovation

One of the more difficult things about innovation is categorizing it and deciding what to do about it. It is extensive and diverse by nature. From changing the organizational structure and compensation logic of a business to pricing and partnering strategies to new products and services, every facet of every business is ripe for innovation. 

Deciding what to do about it (and when!) is a tough decision. Should you rely on an internal manager or external consultant? Talk with an academic? External partner? What? The variety of options is not only dizzying. It's paralyzing. Plotting different categories of innovation in an overview can be done in many ways. 

One of the most common ways to do this is to create a matrix like this:

Matrixes like these help you determine your starting point based on two questions you can ask yourself. The questions can differ, which will lead to different plotted categories of innovation. Exemplary questions could be "how well are (1) the problem and (2) the domain defined? or "what is (1) the impact on the market and (2) technology newness". The goal of plotting innovation categories: once you have answered the questions, you bring focus to the table, and your options of possible actions drop precipitously, providing the clarity that can lead to action. 


Let's take a better look at the matrix and its different categories of innovation. They are to give you guidance in the characteristics of the innovation itself, focusing on the concept of innovation itself. Not where to apply it in your company, for that we use different overviews as you will see later.  

**1. Incremental innovation**

Most innovations are incremental, gradual, and continuous improvements in the current market's existing concepts, products, or services. 

[Incremental innovations]( https://www.viima.com/blog/incremental-innovation) are just a little better than the previous version of the product or service. This is because they have only slight variations on an existing product formulation or service delivery method. As a result, products can be made smaller, easier to use, or more attractive without changing the core functionality, and services can be made more efficient through constant improvement. 
Although incremental innovation does not create new markets and often does not leverage radically new technology, it can attract higher paying customers because it fulfills the customer needs to be identified from their behavior or feedback. The product or service may also appeal to a larger, mainstream market if you're capable of providing the same functionalities and value at a lower cost. TV is a classic example of both of these scenarios as it's constantly improved, and new models are available. At the same time, the core idea and the components remain mostly the same. The mainstream customer can, for example, have a 50" LED television for just a couple of hundred dollars. In contrast, the more demanding customers can easily spend thousands on a 75" OLED TV.

**2. Disruptive innovation**

[Disruptive innovation]( https://www.viima.com/blog/disruptive-innovation) is a concept introduced by professor, academic, and business consultant Clayton Christensen first in an [HBR article]( https://hbr.org/1995/01/disruptive-technologies-catching-the-wave) and later in his book [Innovator's Dilemma]( https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244). Disruptive innovation is a theory that refers to a concept, product, or service that creates a new value network either by entering an existing market or by creating an entirely new market.

What makes disruptive innovation difficult is that established organizations are rational when making decisions related to their existing business. As a result, they fail to adjust to the new competition because they're too focused on optimizing the current offering or business model that has proven successful in the market so far. Thus, the market is generally disrupted by a new entrant rather than an incumbent. This phenomenon called Innovator's Dilemma is quite logical because the existing market is often more prominent, and the margins are better. It is briefly explained [here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=19&v=mbPiAzzGap0&feature=emb_logo).

**3. Sustaining innovation **

Sustaining innovation is the opposite of disruptive innovation as it exists in the current market. Instead of creating new value networks, it improves and grows the existing ones by satisfying a customer's needs.

![Source]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koiosonline/literature-images/main/blockchain-level3/bc-3-1-2-1-what-is-innovation-and-why-does-innovation-matter-image2.png)
[Source Viima]( https://www.viima.com/blog/how-to-manage-disruptive-innovation-introducing-the-innovation-matrix?_ga=2.191783146.1988751669.1570174223-1644858992.1569407703) 


Traditional business methods and sustainable innovations are often sufficient because they are the most profitable and lower risks. On the other hand, disruptions typically enable top-line growth: significant market share growth or the creation of an entirely new market but aren't generally profitable for a long time because it makes sense for disruptors to invest heavily in development.
Sustaining innovations, in turn, continue to grow the market slowly but no longer in the same proportion. At this point, the focus shifts to increasing profits.
An example of a once disruptive, currently fully sustaining, and profitable innovation is the iPhone. The recent versions of the phone appeal to the same customer segments and do not create new value networks. As the criticism of the lack of innovativeness of the new iPhone has increased, the firm's profits have grown at the same pace.

**4. Radical innovation**

Radical innovation is rare as it has similar characteristics to disruptive innovation but is different. It simultaneously uses revolutionary technology and a new business model. 
Radical innovation solves global problems and addresses needs in entirely new ways than what we're used to and even provides solutions to needs and issues we didn't know we had, completely transforming the market or even the entire economy. Although radical innovations are rare, there have been more and more of them in the recent past.

## So now what?
Steve Jobs, the late CEO of Apple, famously said, *"It is tough to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them."* Many interpreted this as suggesting that there is no point in consulting with consumers about innovation. Then others say consumers should be the source of innovation. Instead, the 3 Cs of modern creativity are community, crowdsourcing, and co-creation, according to John Wilkins of Naked Communications. 

So who is right? Jobs with "customers don't know what they want" or Wilkins with "involving customers"? 

They are both right. It depends on the kind of innovation you are seeking. That is why it is vital to know the different types of innovation. 

Another important reason to understand the categories is to realize where you stand and what strategy you should apply. The categories of innovation are interconnected. As the chart below shows, radical innovation typically follows incremental innovation. It delivers excellent leaps forward in terms of revenue or efficiency. In contrast, the tweaks offered by incremental innovation result in benefits that tend to be more modest. 





The iPhone example is a famous example of radical innovation. It reimagined the scope of what a "phone" could do. It rewrote the rules for many markets, including photography, e-commerce, maps/navigation systems, television, movies, and music. But, of course, Steve Jobs was right to suggest the idea for an iPhone would never have come out of a focus group. Most of the time, innovation takes place within a set of rules. But, occasionally, something happens, which dislocates the framework and changes the rules of the game. We call this discontinuous or disruptive innovation. By definition, disruptive innovations are not everyday events. But, they can redefine the space, open up new opportunities, challenge existing players and create new markets.

Disruptive innovation usually comes through the emergence of new technology. For example, the invention of the steam engine triggered the industrial revolution. Tim Berners-Lee's pioneering work on the WWW helped shape the internet as most people perceive it today. Satoshi Nakamoto's design paper may trigger a similar disruptive innovation in the world of finance and decentralized networking. Hence, we will study disruptive innovation in detail in this course.
