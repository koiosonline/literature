# BC-3.1.3.3 The selection phase

## Phase 2: Selection (what are we going to do and why?) 

This phase is all about choosing innovation projects: which of the ideas are worth pursuing further? Challenge: match (external) opportunity with (internal) capabilities to maximize return on investment. Of course, there are way more opportunities than resources. Planning these resources requires processes of decision-making under uncertainty. Therefore this phase is the focus on STRATEGY. In this session, we move our attention to step 2 (the Selection process) to explore how we can select between innovative candidate projects under uncertainty and risk conditions.

To make the right decisions, you can use multiple tools and methods. We will discuss the following topics in that regard: 

* Resource committing 

* Innovation funnel

* Stage-Gate models 

* Portfolio management

* Mapping the selection space


## Resource committing 
An effective search process will generate many innovative ideas. But no organization possesses adequate resources to follow up all ideas it generates. Even a large organization will generate more ideas than the projects it can implement given resource constraints.

Hence, project selection becomes a critical skill: 

*  Selecting is about resource commitment – choosing to go in one direction means ignoring opportunities elsewhere (opportunity cost).

*  Organizations cannot afford to innovate at random – some framework for guidance in project selection under uncertainty is needed. 

* This framework must be flexible enough – innovation is not about early detailed plans and systematic follow-through since conditions change and must be re-assessed all the time 

* Knowledge and risk management are keys to this process: the more we know about something, the better we can calculate risk. This puts a premium on early knowledge (acquired through R&D, market research, competitor analysis trend-spotting, etc.). We can think of innovation as a process of reducing uncertainty while increasing resource commitment. So in short:

## Innovation funnels

So, we need to also cater for project continuation and termination. This is meeting the challenge of uncertainty. Innovation management is about transforming market uncertainty into a calculated risk. There can never be a guarantee of success; but, we can review options and assign approximate probabilities to the chances of successful outcomes. An exemplary model for managing this selection process is the innovation funnel:

## Stage-Gate model

We move from phase to phase within this model as well. A model that supports/manages the process and resources is a stage-gate model. It looked from a project management perspective. Managing innovation is balancing the costs of continuing with projects that may not succeed and the dangers of closing down too soon on promising opportunities. Stage-gate models allow a gradual approach to committing resources as more knowledge is gained and pre-defined criteria are met. Structured systems with clear decision points and agreed criteria are needed.

## Portfolio management – spreading the risks 

Even the smallest firm will need to manage many innovation activities running at the same time. This poses the question of which projects to devote resources to, balancing risks and rewards that change all the time.Portfolio management is about managing an array of simultaneous projects. Without it, there may be:

* No limit to projects taken on (resources will be spread too thin)

* Reluctance to kill (de-select) projects (leading to resource starvation, cost overruns, and failures)

 * Lack of strategic focus in project mix (unimportant projects, random selection, opportunity costs)

* Ambiguous selection criteria (politics, power games, emotions as determinants of project selection)
