# BC-3.3.1.4 Introducing blockchain governance


>ðŸ’¡ You could say that there are two main categories of blockchain governance: internal governance OF the blockchain & external governance BY the blockchain. Within those categories are sub-divisions. 

## External blockchain governance (macro)
What are the implications of a decentralized distributed ledger? As mentioned before: removing centralized TTP (1) and automated changes in the state of the ledger (2) can lead to new forms for societal governance! Think peer-to-peer transactions with more security, trustless without hierarchy, and with a leveled playing field without thresholds in an open-source environment on a global level*. 


## Internal blockchain governance (micro)
Also, split into two sections
1.	Governance regarding day-by-day operations, like the recording of transactions and blocks. Think "which transactions and which blocks are valid"â€”this concerns topics like consensus and protocol rules. Exemplary categories are decentralized, hybrid, or centralized. 
2.	Governance regarding software improvements of the protocol, the "software updates" (= who is allowed to make changes, how does the ecosystem upgrades the protocol. * Once again: different blockchains, different flavors! 

As you might have guessed from your gut feeling or the definitions, most of the work in governance is playing politics. The same applies to blockchain governance because, eventually, all blockchains are governed. Still, the blockchain governance outcomes like forms and amount of centralization will be driven by the politics of participants in the public blockchain space.
For a blockchain community to successfully govern its blockchain, the members need to coordinate or somehow be coordinated. At a minimum, node operators, developers, and the users of the trademark have to corporate. Blockchains can have big communities that form diverse ecosystems that include many participants and stakeholders that don't core developers, node operators, and users of trademarks. These stakeholders might include block explorers and other low-level service providers, exchanges, speculators, application developers, users, journalists, and passive observers, to name just a few. On the other hand, blockchain communities might also be just a team of core developers running their nodes, promoting their protocol in hopes of one day having a bigger community.

>ðŸ’¡ Remember: different blockchains = different flavors 

## The Double-Edged Sword of On-Chain Governance
On-chain governance is a double-edged sword. On the upside, it helps make sure a process is consistently followed, increasing coordination and fairness. It also allows for quicker decision-making. On the downside, it's risky because the metasystem becomes harder to change once instituted. Moreover, anything put directly into code can be exploited or gamed more quickly and easily if flawed. Vlad Zamfir, a principal architect of Ethereum's proof of stake, feels "the risks far outweigh the rewards" and "represent an extremely risky proposition".
For some use cases, tending towards being static may be good. This may be especially true for a store of value. Perhaps lower-level protocols should lean toward stasis and conservatism â€” "measure twice and cut once" â€” while higher-level protocols should be more flexible â€” "move fast and break things".

## Bitcoin Governance 
There is a wide range of views regarding what the purpose of Bitcoin's governance should be. For example, what outcomes should governance optimize for?

Bitcoin was the first successful attempt to create a standalone blockchain. Let's examine it as a base:

**1. Incentives**

Developers: increase the value of existing token holdings, social recognition, and maintain control over future direction.

Miners: increase value of existing token holdings, expected future block rewards, and expected future transactions fees.

Users: increase the value of existing token holdings, increase functional utility (e.g., store of value, uncensorable transactions, file storage).

**2. Mechanisms for coordination**

Mostly off-chain. Developers coordinate through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process and a mailing list. Miners can coordinate on-chain in the sense that they are creating the chain itself.

**Resulting system**

The checks and balances system created is somewhat analogous to the US government and has several benefits. Similar to the Senate submitting new bills, developers submit pull requests. Similar to the judiciary, miners decide whether or not to adopt the laws in practice. Like the executive branch, the network nodes can veto by not running a version that aligns with what the miners are running. And similar to citizens, the users can revolt. Finally, economic incentives dictate that it is in everyone's best interest to maintain trust in the system. For example, if miners alienated all the users, the tokens would decrease in value and go out of business. As the first system of its kind, it's incredible that Bitcoin is still going strong.

The systemic incentives and mechanisms of coordination in Ethereum are similar to Bitcoin at the moment.
Dynamics will change as Ethereum moves to proof of stake. The power of miners will be replaced by anyone who holds a sufficient amount of Ether to run a virtual miner (a "validator"). This is especially true as solutions will allow even the smallest Ether holder to participate, flattening the distinction between a miner and a user and potentially reducing the biggest centralization risk in Bitcoin.

The incentives of core developers remain the same. However, coordination around challenging issues has been swifter and smoother than in Bitcoin to date. This is due to 1) a culture more open to change because [Ethereum was created as a reaction to what could not be done in a rigid Bitcoin environment]( https://coinjournal.net/vitalik-buterin-early-versions-ethereum-supposed-launch-bitcoin/) and 2) direction from Vitalik, who is widely trusted in the community.

Current weaknesses in the model include 1) over-reliance on its creator (Vitalik) and 2) like Bitcoin, limited ways to incentivize core development, forcing more projects to create tokens to support themselves. 

## Other examples (bit outdated examples)

## Five possible landscapes?


Five examples of possible futures of blockchain governance (not excluding) [Source]( https://blog.goodaudience.com/blockchain-governance-101-eea5201d7992)
 
1.	** Autonomous Blockchains**
In this vision for the future of blockchain governance, blockchain governance essentially does nothing other than ensuring that the blockchain keeps functioning according to the pre-determined rules of protocol. This is accompanied by a norm that the protocol should not change unless necessary.

2.	**Blockchain Governance Capture**
In this scenario, blockchain governance is captured by an existing governance system. I'm going to describe four examples of capture briefly:
Corporate capture is where blockchain governance is captured by a corporation's corporate governance that becomes the sole source of legitimacy in blockchain governance.
State capture is where the regulators and courts of major jurisdictions capture the blockchain governance of different "regional blockchains". For example, one day, "Ethereum USA" might enforce US economic sanctions, "Ethereum Europe" might enforce GDPR. In contrast "Ethereum China" might enforce capital control policies.
Developer capture, where the blockchain core developers capture governance because their software development process becomes the only source of legitimacy in blockchain governance.
Cartel capture, a cartel of participants in blockchain governance (for example, a cartel of node operators or a cartel of coin holders) collude to control blockchain governance.

3.	**Internet Censorship as Blockchain Governance**
In this scenario, rather than allowing their publics to be exposed to or to access public blockchains, major jurisdictions outlaw and censor access to the blockchain that does not comply with local regulations.

4.	**Governance via Public International Law or Diplomacy**
In this possible blockchain governance outcome, public blockchains are governed by international institutions from the legal tradition. For example, this could be an entity chosen or formed by the United Nations or established through a multilateral agreement between states.


5.	**Governance via International Private Cooperation**
In this scenario, there is a global blockchain governance system that is open for participation by the public. That system could be driven by associations of private people, corporations, and NGOs. This is arguably how we do internet governance today, through institutions like ICANN, IETF, WC3, IGF, etc.
Is this itâ€¦.? DYOR!!
Further Thinking: 
I encourage you to think about how each of these scenarios might impact you, to be skeptical about my assumptions and to come up with your visions of the possible futures of blockchain governance, and to think about how those affect you, too. Finally, think about how the outcomes impact the people you know.


[Good response]( https://medium.com/cryptolawreview/blockchain-governance-102-9912a88da91d) to Zamfir's article: "You can't do effective governance if you have FUD concerning Law. Not saying Zamfir has Law FUD. Just saying that you can't do good governance if you have Law FUD." In short: You need a healthy mix of dry & wet code concerning current law systems. 

And Zamfir's [response]( https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/my-intentions-for-blockchain-governance-801d19d378e5) to that article. We suggest reading up on them and find out how not doing your research or not thinking could lead to dangerous situations.
