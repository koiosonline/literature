#BC-3.3.2.10 Monetization smart contracts - Revenue structures


## Monetization of services 

We can think of various ways that smart contracts can be used for the monetization of blockchain services: 

* An efficiency stimulus – reducing costs and increasing speed by automation and disintermediation.
Are ICOs just a more efficient way of raising money? Efficient for whom, the users or the project owners?

* Monetization of IoT devices – think about an actual sharing economy, not the one where a central service provider gets 99% of the profit. Still, real peer-to-peer sharing of physical devices or the data from their sensors, etc., sometimes called „blockchain cooperatives“.

* Extending the functionalities of the underlying blockchain – for a prime example, oracles seem to be a necessary add-on. Yet, another interesting example is scheduling: since a blockchain doesn‘t know anything about human time, it is not trivial to execute a contract on a specific date/time, but, surprisingly, there is a working Ethereum market for that (Ethereum Alarm Clock).

## Monetization of dApps 

For a comprehensive list of dApps on Ethereum, see https://www.stateofthedapps.com/. Despite most of them being free, the logic is still the same as with applications on mobile app stores. The developers would seek some way compensation along the way.

**Tokens as a revenue model**
[Conceptual Framework for Legal & Risk Assessment of Blockchain Crypto Property ](https://www.mme.ch/fileadmin/files/documents/Publikationen/170927_Magazinbeitrag_BCP_Genesis_Version.pdf) can help you with understanding different kinds of tokens and their classification. Unfortunately, there is currently no globally accepted classification (possibly due to the rapid innovation and changes in token types). 


## Challenges with monetization
Few aspects need to be considered when discussing ways of profiting out of smart contracts. However, despite most of them being obvious, they must not be ignored.
Decentralized nature of smart contracts: they execute on all nodes in the network, and the authors/owners might be known only by their network addresses or community nicknames. All these beg the questions of liability, jurisdiction, capabilities of stopping malicious/buggy contracts, etc.

Open source preference: while on the one hand, open-source is a matter of gaining trust in the decentralized, pseudonymous world, on the other hand, it brings a fundamental problem: anyone can copy the contract and use it without paying the premium of the original one.
For that reason, some projects are placing intentional bugs in their code to work as a honeypot to any competing copycat project – but that is very dangerous and goes against the spirit of open source in the first place.

## Conclusions
Smart contracts are in many aspects still a bleeding-edge technology, bringing with it all the risks and possible high future rewards. We should not be shocked when major failures happen, such as the TheDAO incident and many past attacks on the Ethereum network. All enthusiasm with the disruptive potential of this technology must be accompanied by care and due diligence.
Bitcoin blockchain widely opened the door to transparency. This principle is also maintained in other public blockchains that enable complex smart contracts. It is almost expected for any project that is building on this technology to have its code open-source. However, some use-cases require confidentiality of transactions, and we are only at the brink of new incoming privacy capabilities. We can expect privacy to be prioritized very shortly.
Currently, large-scale direct profiting from smart contracts is still almost non-existent. However, that should not be worrying, as smart contracts have a fantastic potential for monetization, waiting for the right time.
