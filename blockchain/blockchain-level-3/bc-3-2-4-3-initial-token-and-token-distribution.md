# BC-3.2.4.3 Initial token and token distribution

The initial distribution of a cryptocurrency is an example of mechanism design in practice. 
•	Satoshi Nakamoto had a far-reaching problem in distributing bitcoins so that it would be fair and rewarding for those that support the project. As it started with "one CPU, one vote", the distribution of bitcoins was within reach of anybody who would bother installing the node and run/test/review it.
•	Vitalik Buterin decided differently, allocating a vast amount of ether to the founders and developers to ensure a long-term dedication of the team.
•	More about initial coin offerings (ICO's) and other means of distribution in a later section (trading)

## Benefit the end goals and ecosystem
There are many possibilities to distribute tokens of your network. The key is to distribute them in such a way that benefits the end goal and ecosystem. Unfortunately, many ICO's and Airdrops distributions failed to do so. Some common examples of where it can go wrong in the token allocation [(source)]( https://medium.com/@ryanshea/the-top-rules-for-token-distribution-economics-a0df50530e7f): 

1.	Too much is focused on fundraising, and not enough is focused on real business models and growth.

2.	The network users and developers do not hold enough tokens, and the investors and creators own too many tokens.


3.	A lack of price flexibility can make the network too costly to use and can impede growth.
Remember: the token sale should simply be a bonus that can facilitate distribution and raise money. Instead, it was one of the main focuses of many projects, which fundamentally screwed up a healthy token distribution. 

## Price flexibility explained
Two pricing methods can address these problems and are suitable for different types of services:

* periodically-adjusted pricing

* auction-based pricing

Periodically-adjusted global pricing is seen with the minimum dust fee in Bitcoin and the conversion rate from Ethereum to Ethereum Gas. It's great in that it allows for adjustments that can withstand token value changes. This is perfect for simple resources that aren't fixed in the number of actions performed.

Auction-based pricing, meanwhile, is something we see with the pricing of Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions. It's perfectly suited here because including transactions in blocks depends on a fixed block space resource that can be lined up against highly variable demand. And auctions are a great way to allocate fixed resources with variable demand.
 
## Final remark about setting up commons
* "The transition will be bumpy and shocking to many. It may even be nasty, as dying clans struggle to hold on to the past at all costs. But eventually, they will pass into the pages of history like the Trilobites. And when it's all over, nobody will mourn the loss of the old, broken, decaying, power-hungry and violent networks of kings, queens, mobs, and corporations" *
