# BC-3.1.7.4 Two exemplary reasons to fork: Segwit & Bitcoin Cash

One famous fork from 2018 was caused by improvements made in the signing of bitcoin transactions. In short: the digital signature (the witness) was separated from the transactions (segregated). [Here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=DzBAG2Jp4bg) or [here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtOjjB4mD8k) are short clips explaining the concept. 

•	Transactions in Bitcoin have two main types of information contained within them: 

1.	One part is what sum is transferred from where to where, in the form of inputs and outputs
2.	Proof that the respective private vital holders authorize those transferences and can be validly performed (this part is called the “witness” part). 

Removing this witness part from the transaction enables more transactions to be recorded to the blockchain but also allows more forms of smart contracts to run (needed for the off-chain scaling solution Lightning Network). Read more about it [here](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-segwit/). 

## Other Exemplary reasons to fork – Bitcoin Blocksize debate 

The reason why we started this debate is that it emphasizes once again: DYOR! Remain critical, think for yourself and spar with people with different views (and learn from each other!). Some sources that might help you form your opinion:
