# BC-3.2.1 The evolution of trust

## About this chapter?
Blockchain technology and their inherent often decentralized protocols and distributed ledgers enable new infrastructures, which lead to new forms of governance and how we transact. Trustor trustless is one of the core foundations of this new infrastructure, powered by game theory principles. This paragraph is about this core engine: game theory and the forms of trust and roles actors can play in an ecosystem.
