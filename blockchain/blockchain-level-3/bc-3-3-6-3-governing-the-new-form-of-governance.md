# BC-3.3.6.3 Governing the new form of governance



>üí° Chapter in short: build for systems that can survive a World War III and the ravages of time

Governmentality can be thought of as practices or actions governed by subjects (a term by French philosopher Michel Foucault). The meaning is not limited to enacting governance of a state. Still, it generally applies to "conduct, " from self-control to managing a household.
Concerning algorithmic governance, a governmentality perspective suggests that governance in a DAO is more than just keeping participants together when there is no hierarchical legal structure and keeping them in order with its rules. Instead, it uncovers a much broader set of actions and mechanisms that constitute the workings of DAOs.

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac">‚ùì What can participants do, how can they change the DAO, the implications of correcting mistakes by rolling back transactions, the rules of making a fork, etc.?</blockquote>

Questions like these are pesky if you try to answer them. Then, all of a sudden, the decentralization dissolves, unstoppable code becomes stoppable, cheap transactions become expensive and opposing groups of people engage in conflicts.

## "Governance crisis."

In 2016, Primavera De Filippi and Benjamin Loveluck published a paper that nobody wanted to say: there is no running away from the human factor, even in an environment of purely technical protocols and algorithms ‚Äì as much as possible, Bitcoin stands for decentralization, it faces significant political pressures.
The paper has a telling title: "The invisible politics of Bitcoin: [governance crisis of a decentralized infrastructure,"]( https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/invisible-politics-bitcoin-governance-crisis-decentralised-infrastructure) and it is recommended to read, despite perhaps a little bias, but you can try to find some counter-arguments.

To summarize the paper with regards to Bitcoin: Bitcoin aims to be the self-governing and self-sustaining ‚Üí market-driven approach to social trust and coordination. However, the development of the protocol is concentrated in a group of developers (an open group, but still). Thus, we can observe polarization of "governance by the infrastructure" (Bitcoin protocol) vs. "governance of the infrastructure" (developers).

##  Ethereum 
Ethereum is very different in this aspect: The Ethereum Foundation is recognized in the community, and with many signed agreements with various institutions, we could argue it is accountable and legitimate.

The funding of developers is much more organized. There are grants, bounties, rewards, etc. But, more importantly, a considerable amount of its currency was pre-allocated to fund ongoing development. However, despite more developers and groups, there is one developer with a higher status, the author, Vitalik Buterin. It's a bit like if Satoshi Nakamoto was still around in Bitcoin. Still, if Vitalik would do something out of the "ordinary", it would raise suspicions, and the community could easily reject him.

Further on, the paper addresses three entwined challenges of online peer-production communities, such as Bitcoin: 

1.	community borders ‚Äì are open for the infrastructure due to PoW, but the development discussions are open up until changes need to be made in code, and that's when the developers draw a line of what design will be implemented and whatnot, the BIP process is an example of that;

2.	incentives for participation ‚Äì are clear for the infrastructure with mining rewards, but for developers, it is more indirect, in a way that it is about social reputation with the technical expertise or charisma;

3.	Pacification of conflicts ‚Äì is straightforward for the infrastructure as the protocol resolves any issues by technological means. Still, it is a big challenge for the developers that can lead to deadlocks and personal fights, as we have seen how divisive the implementation of SegWit is.


## Conclusion 
In conclusion, the paper states that: "‚Ä¶ socio-technical systems cannot ‚Äì by their embeddedness into a social and cultural context ‚Äì ensure their self-governance and self-sustainability through technology alone. Any technology will eventually fall prey to the social, cultural, and political pressures of the context in which it operates".

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac">‚ùì So should "technocratic power structure" be replaced by "institutional framework", as De Filippi and Loveluck suggest? </blockquote>

While we can easily see the benefits of standardized governance, coordination among actors, there are good reasons why we would instead want to preserve incoordination (Thaddeus Dryja, Decentralization and Incoordination, 2017):


* we want an immutable blockchain (is this the whole point?)
* we need dependable functionality (upgrading software for hard forks is cumbersome and dangerous)
* incoordination enables uniform access (permissionless use that is constrained only by the internal rules of the protocol and by no means limited by something external to the system, like social status, IP address, blacklists‚Ä¶)
* Having loose governance means a certain degree of technological stagnation, which is both a tradeoff and a guarantee for immutability.
