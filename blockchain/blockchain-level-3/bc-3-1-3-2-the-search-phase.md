# BC-3.1.3.2 The search phase


## Search, and you shall find 

The search phase is all about how to find opportunities. Bringing new ideas into a system – systematically! Ideas may come from R&D, ‘eureka’ moments, copying, market signals, regulation, etc. The challenge: how do we organize an effective search process? Focus on ENVIRONMENT. In this session, we discuss: 

* Understand where innovative ideas come from (sources of innovation)
* Explore the role of knowledge push and demand pull in innovation creation 
* Define different types of innovation networks

## Knowledge push as input for innovation 

A knowledge push is a giant leap in knowledge created by individuals or organizations and their systematic exploration of knowledge frontiers by the scientific. It could be communities or, for example, Satoshi Nakamoto. Organized R&D effort has often been behind product and process innovations. 
Scientific progress is the outcome of the continuous small-scale invention coupled with occasional breakthroughs. It may take years or decades to perfect a specific design – and a single innovation to disrupt a whole industry.

During the years 1960-1950, process innovation based on a linear model, was defined. In this simple model: an innovation begins with scientific research and in later stages of product development, manufacturing, and marketing, and at the end, product and service, or new process will be successfully sold. According to this model, we should develop scientific researches and emphasize research and development. The market needs are also defined on research and development activities, and they don’t have an independent existence (= strange). Based on this model, significant investments in research and development have been made. The model was supported after World War II, especially when the atomic bombs on military research were discovered and produced.

## Demand-pull as input for innovation
Another obvious source of innovation is the needs of the market (users, customers, adopters). In innovation management, the challenge is to develop a clear understanding of customer needs. Needs and innovations are not static, and needs sometimes aren’t even real! (only perceived as needs)
Demand-pull is also the outcome of continuous small-scale elaboration/differentiation, coupled with occasional radical new product/process offer. 

Demand-driven innovation ideas may come from niche markets. Start-ups are better positioned to identify and exploit such markets, thereby igniting processes for market disruption. 

From early 1960, the second linear model of innovation given to the economic vision was shaped. In this model, innovation, requisites, and market demand were the direct cause of the development of new technology for companies. So in this model, most of the innovations result from departments that work directly with the customers. In this model, the market will determine in what projects the R & D of the company must be invested in. 

## The Doubling model as input for innovation

But most of the researchers commented that they could not express the innovation process in simple linear forms. For example: sometimes scientific researches cause new products in the markets. In contrast, sometimes the market forces the R&D section to innovations. Hence the reason a third model was “developed” exhibiting the sequence of operations in innovations. Another target of this model is being feedbacked between the R&D section and market. 

## Innovation networks = with whom are we innovating?
* Innovation has always been a multi-player game 

* The concept of networks has become popular as it offers the benefits of internal development, but with few of the drawbacks of collaboration

* Networks are appropriate when the benefits of co-specialization outweigh the costs of management

**But networks are complex: **

* Networks can be tight or loose, depending on the quantity, quality, and type of interactions * Network typically have emergent properties: the whole may be greater than the sum of its parts

* Flow and sharing of information may benefit all members – but the position of an organization in the network (network centrality) is a matter of strategic importance and determines one’s power and influence in the network

* Sources (and benefits!) of power include technology, expertise, trust, economic strength, legitimacy, etc.

**Collective knowledge efficiency:**

* Pool together complementary knowledge sets

* Reduce risks by sharing them

* Gain access to technologies and markets

* Benefit from shared learning

* Long-lasting networks can create the capability to ride out major waves of change in the 
technological and economic environment.

## The different network types

1. Entrepreneur-based: bringing different complementary resources together to exploit opportunities.

2. Communities of practice: Networks that involve players inside and across organizations (e.g., the network of bitcoin enthusiasts)

3. Regional clusters: Networks of players being geographically close to each other, thriving on the opportunities afforded by proximity and shared culture/norms (e.g., Silicon Valley)

4. Sector networks: Often organized by sector or business associations to bring their members together; driven by shared interests in preserving and extending shared innovations in products or processes

5. New product development consortia: Sharing knowledge and skills in developing new products, standards, or technologies (e.g., the NFC forum)
