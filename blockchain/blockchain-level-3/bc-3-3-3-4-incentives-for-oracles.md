# BC-3.3.3.4 Incentives for oracles

Oracles provide a needed service to smart contracts, and there is no way around them. Therefore they require compensation for their work. Unlike miners, they are on the market. They are competing with other data providers (currently for a minimal number of customers). Hence, they must take care of their reputation (identity!).

Suppose oracles participate in an anonymous, decentralized network. In that case, they can change their identities and canâ€˜t accumulate reputation, i.e. they are changing the addresses of their contracts. Moreover, they might [even charge extra for their honesty (for a mind stretch, read this blogpost from Paul Sztorc: Oracles are the Real Smart Contracts]( http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/contracts-oracles-sidechains/).


Regarding prediction markets and relying on one oracle only, it is worth noting that the oracle itself might participate in a bet with high odds for a one-time profit and then disappear forever or later re-appear under another name.
