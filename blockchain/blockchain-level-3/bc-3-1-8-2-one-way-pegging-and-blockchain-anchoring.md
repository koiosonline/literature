# BC-3.1.8.2 One way pegging & Blockchain Anchoring 

Pegged Sidechains are used to transfer assets between multiple blockchains. Despite this bidirectional transfer of assets between various blockchains, they are isolated, i.e., any cryptographic break in one blockchain will not be reflected in the other blockchain. Sidechains offer a way for new technologies to be implemented without affecting the main chain. It is done by implementing technical changes through the creation of independent but essentially similar systems called sidechains. With sidechains, users can safely and temporarily experiment with them. In addition, users donâ€™t have to keep track of the sidechains that they are currently not using.
Pegged Sidechains:
Pegged sidechain is nothing but a blockchain attached to the parent chain (blockchain) through the two-way peg mechanism, which allows the bidirectional transfer of assets between the parent chain and the sidechain at a fixed deterministic exchange rate by simply reusing the existing bitcoin currency.

What is a one-way peg?
In a one-way peg, the transfer of assets occurs when one blockchain destroys its assets publicly. Upon deletion of these assets, a new blockchain will create new assets.
