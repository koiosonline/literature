1. It starts with the desire to make meaning as opposed to make money (change the world)

2. Make a mantra, a two to the four-word explanation of why your meaning should exist. Don’t make mission statements. Make a mantra! 

3. Jump to the next curve (and be careful: don’t define yourself of what you do, define yourself in what you believe and the benefits you provide). 

4. Roll the dice (your product should be deep, intelligent, complete (total package, the totality), empowering, and finally: elegant. 

5. Don’t worry, be crappy. 

6. Let 100 flowers blossom (don’t be proud and let others reform your product!)

7. Polarize people (love or hate your product, don’t do this intentionally, but great products polarise people. Don’t be afraid.

8. Churn, baby, churn: version 1, 1.1 1.2 1.3 2,0, etc. Change it, change it, change it, keep evolving it. 

9. Niche thyself (be unique) “We do not merely want to be the best of the best. We want to be the only ones who do what we do” - Jerry Garcia, The Grateful Dead

10. Perfect your pitch. Start with something customized to the audience, 10-20-30 rule: the optimal number of slides is 10, present them in max 20 minutes, optimal font size is 30 points (divide the age of the oldest person in the room by 2).	

11. Bonus: don’t let the bozos grind you down.
