# BC-3.2.3.4 “Categories” within “categories”?

Other than the four main categories (1. transaction, 2. platform, 3. utility, 4. asset-backed), and the different roles tokens can play within those categories. There are also more categories within those categories. So there are other possible ways to categorize tokens, sort other than looking at the token's use-cases and determining the role, looking at the characteristics in its design (distribution and such). 

An example for category three, the utility token would be the split between “work tokens” and “burn & mint” tokens. In the work token model, a service provider stakes (AKA bonding) the native token of the network to earn the right to perform work for the network. In the BME model, unlike the work token model, tokens are a proprietary payment currency. But unlike traditional proprietary payment currencies, users who want to use a service do not directly pay a counterparty to use the service. 

## Burn tokens
Instead, users burn tokens. Yes, the customer burns the money.
