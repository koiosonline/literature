# BC-3.3.6.2 What are the possibilities regarding DAO governance?


## Benefits
We usually talk about blockchain technology lowering transaction costs and increasing speed in operating a business. However, there is potential for it to impact corporate architecture also. Don and Alex Tapscott predictions [Blockchain Revolution, 2016]:

* Search costs – finding new talent and customers 

* beyond internet search: respecting people's privacy through selective revealing data, multidimensional searching not just data at that particular time, but through all its lifecycle, and account for value in search queries

* Contracting costs – reaching an agreement and commit to it

* Coordination costs – internal managing of people

* distribution of responsibility, authority, and power is easier with blockchain as it provides persistence and stability in an organization, even when there is no hierarchy

* Costs of (re-)building trust – preserving the integrity

* transparency and trust codified in software


## New business models

Tapscott's also defined four categories of new business models, varying in the degree of functional complexity and human involvement:

* Smart Contracts – when considering them on their own, they involve the least complexity and human interaction

* Open Networked Enterprises – utilizing smart contracts, enterprises can "open up "and couple with others in the network

* Autonomous Agents – more or less sophisticated devices or software that adjusts its actions to achieve its goals and can be owned by nobody but themselves

* Distributed Autonomous Enterprises – the most complex model, in which members participate through smart contracts to seek a common goal, where actions are not triggered only by humans but by anything that can interact with the blockchain


## Update

DAO's are mushrooming across web3 and have their big breakthrough thanks to new DeFi dApps, which hold large sums of money, which need to be governed. More extensive research will soon be available and discussed in live classes.
