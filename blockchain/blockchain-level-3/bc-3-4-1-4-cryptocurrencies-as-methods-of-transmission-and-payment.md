## An overview for Bitcoin as a payment processor 

According to the report, bitcoin has lower costs from a merchant’s perspective. Still, it is not the same from a customer’s perspective that also has:


* Technical complexity of storing the bitcoins

* No recourse against merchant

* No incentive against cash or other means of payment, even cards

* Exposure to volatility

* Difficulty of acquiring coins

* Lower exchange rate than average

## Networks Emerging Off-Chain
Payment processors also exchanged (like Coinbase) effectively loop this system internally by providing both the supply of bitcoins and merchant processing. In this manner, they are a vertical structure that allows them to act on a net settlement basis and perform several transactions “off-chain”, which provides:

* Instant transaction confirmation No exchange risk due to the above

* No transaction fees towards miners or the Bitcoin network

* Increased liquidity in both fiat and BTC, as only net balances are cashed out Any size of transactions without limitations (micropayments)

* The potential for some level of transaction reversibility or customer protection

This also means that they are a centralized payment hub, providing both the payment instrument (BTC) for fiat, executing the payment, and redeeming the tool for fiat again (but not provisioning credit). In the previous session, this model is closest to how Amex and Discover operate, being both the issuer and the acquirer.

The millions of wallets and thousands of merchants Coinbase has thus far is probably the best evidence that, for many users, this model is considered a good swap of risks (security, personal responsibility, exchange risk) by adding another party to administer your bitcoins and process the payment. “


## The Lightning Network and similar proposals

** Value proposition for merchants ** 

Current Bitcoin payment processing is ‘better for the merchant. Bitcoin payment processors have several benefits for merchants: 

* Payments are irreversible. Even high-risk transactions have a negligible chance of being fraudulent, regardless of where they came from (high-risk countries, customer not present, etc.)

* Processor assumes all exchange risk

* There are (often) no transaction fees involved (charge $100, receive $100)

* Straightforward and convenient integrations with many e-commerce platforms/ minimal technical involvement needed

* Low or no subscription fees

* No upfront deposits to acquirers, as reserves, in case of chargebacks

>💡 From a merchant’s perspective, what’s not to love? They are exposed to a whole new economic niche they could not interface with before and accept payments globally.

**Value proposition for consumers**

On the consumer side, credit/debit cards present an appealing proposition:

* No fraud risk

* Reversibility

* Rewards/points/cashback

* Broad acceptance

Using Bitcoin for payments, on the other hand, the consumer:

* Will face volatility on Bitcoin balances kept
* Has a much smaller selection of merchants than with credit card networks
* Has to pay an FX spread from the payment processors every time they transact
Has no chargeback protection

* Generally does not have a rewards program


## Learning from the past? 
Credit cards worked through an extended global network of licensees and partners (network effect)
Credit cards leveraged the operation of multiple cooperating parties globally (operational superiority)
Credit cards issuers granted new spending power, managed the underlying risk, and pointed it away from consumers (high incentives and low risk)

**What could we learn from this? ** 

Better customer support/protection is needed, e.g., decentralized escrow and arbitration?

More incentives to purchase with BTC need to be provided, e.g., more discounts or bonuses?

Easier access to buying and using bitcoins, e.g., More supply and demand services?

Provision of credit? Other methods?


## Possible Scenarios	

**Bitcoin stays as-is for retail payments and remains a niche retail payment system for customers not well-served by the current system.** 

* International

* High-risk

* Privacy-sensitive (health, medical, political speech, forbidden content, etc.)

** A payment layer develops above Bitcoin with one or more of the payment processors (Coinbase, BitPay, etc.) that replicates much of the functionality/consumer-friendliness of current payment networks** 

* Directly rewards consumers with points/etc

* Has reversibility

* In this model, Bitcoin would be the clearing system (e.g., FedWire) and, say, Coinbase, would be the equivalent of Visa

One is learning from the past: Larger networks are more valuable. Might Coinbase, Bitpay, and so on, combine their merchant networks?

**Consumers and merchants use Bitcoin directly** 

Unlike with existing RTGS, parties can access the Bitcoin RTGS directly without needing a merchant processor or card issuer, eliminating all fees (and perhaps letting merchants reward consumers directly). Other functions (like arbitration) could be disaggregated into other (optional) decentralized systems. However, this would require significant usability improvements to have mass appeal.


## About reversibility	

A payment network is only useful if consumers want to use it. Centralizing the process of the transaction clearing, as we saw in the previous session: 

* Provides some tools towards increased customer protection

*  Raises fraud risks to merchants, as chargebacks can be used against well-meaning merchants.

In systems with reversibility: buyers may not be allowed to purchase if they are deemed too risky. 

A payment network is only helpful if consumers want to use it. Centralizing the process of the transaction clearing, as we saw in the previous session:

* Raises fraud risks to merchants, as chargebacks can be used against well-meaning merchants.

In systems with reversibility:
* Buyers may not be allowed to purchase if they are deemed too risky

* The costs of other fraud are mutualized to the whole chain of issuers, acquirers, merchants, and the end customers. In systems without reversibility, consumers may not use them. 

Note, however, that the large majority of global transactions still occur with cash that is an irreversible mechanism. Cash, however, in practice is used for smaller, lower-risk transactions so, if Bitcoin remains primarily irreversible, perhaps it might take that role in retail payments


## Conclusions

>💡 Bitcoin payment processing is not very different than its conventional counterparts though possibly structurally more cost-efficient. The value proposition of Bitcoin retail payments is currently in favor of merchants. 
* Irreversible
* Lower transaction fees
* Limited ‘rewards’ to consumers

 

>💡 We can imagine three scenarios, possibly overlapping
* Payment processing maintains the current model and is most appealing to certain retail niches
* Networks develop ‘above’ the Bitcoin RTGS that offer similar benefits to consumers as current payment networks and compete on rewards/price/etc
* Truly decentralized solutions (for payments, arbitration, etc.) emerge
