# BC-3.1.2.2 The 4+1 P's

Okayâ€¦.so now you know all about different general types of innovation and their characteristics. It also gives you a better idea of where to start, what strategy you could use, where you would like to end up. 

But on what should you apply it? On your product, your process? 

## The P's 

You can apply these types of innovation in multiple parts of your organization. Many models will help to do so. One of the more common models to use innovation in your organization is the 4P model, developed by [John Bessant and Joe Tidd]( https://www.ebay.com/p/209729597). The tool lets you discover what part of your organization's innovation can improve and what value it can bring to your business.

It consists of four elements, called the innovation mix: Paradigm, Product, Position, and Process. Not to be mistaken with the market mix and its other 4Ps: Product, Place, Promotion, and Public Relations.

The 4P's are created to understand and help to make the Innovation Strategy. You have determined in the previous level whether you are radical, disruptive, incremental, or sustaining. Now you need to apply that knowledge somewhere in your organization. The 4Ps helps you understand where you are and how you can innovate to improve your Product, Process, Position, and Paradigm. It gives you a direction of where you need to go and which areas of your business you need to innovate. 

>ðŸ’¡ The 4 P's recently has been updated to the 5 Ps by adding the fifth P of 'Platform innovation', mainly thanks to the internet era enabling faster network effects. 

## A brief explanation of the Ps


1.**Product innovation**: what does the company offer to customers? Innovation concerns changes in the things (products/services) an organization provides, e.g., a new type of laptop design, a new way to offer laptop repairment.

2. **Process innovation**: How does the company deliver to customers? Innovations for processes, efficiency, more ease of use, etc. Changes in how the products and services are created and delivered, e.g., Amazon's logistics and vertical/horizontal integration. 

3. **Positioning innovation**: Who's defined as the possible customer? Definition of the market segment = changes in the context in which the products/services are introduced; e.g., Coca Cola's journey from patent medicine to a world-leader in soft drinks

4. **Paradigm innovation**: Changes the where, how, why, or what the product is used for, educating people to understand the need of the product = changes in the underlying mental and business models; e.g., think of digital currencies, blockchain, ICOs, DAOs.

5. **(new) Platform innovation**: Relatively new and includes network effects. Platform innovation is about establishing a solid platform or family, which can then be extended. For example, carmakers produce models, which, although very different, make use of shared components, such as floor plans or chassis.

## P's, digital currencies, and blockchain technology?"

**Product innovation: what does the company offer to customers?**

*Digital currencies*

Digital currencies are based on new inventions in computer science. Think, for example, about solving the Byzantine Generals Problem (under assumptions you know have learned, remember session "Satoshi's cheat"?) = creating new cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs, to address anonymity/fungibility. 

Application of this new product and service: digital currency features leap-frog. It extends many functions of existing financial products (such as near-real-time borderless payments, irreversible transactions, etc.). 

*Blockchain technology*

Blockchain-based innovations may support new applications, such as smart contracts, decentralized trust services, etc.

Private keys that store transferable ownership rights can be used to control physical objects (keys, operation control, etc.), thereby connecting blockchains to IoT and the physical world.
Application tokens are the fuel of decentralized value networks and crowdsourced distributed ventures.

**Process innovation: How does the company deliver to customers? ** 

*Digital currencies*

Digital currencies rely on novel forms of labor and consensus (computational power, proof-of-stake, or other issuance/verification mechanism). Digital currencies bring together many individual innovations into a unique combination with far greater value than the sum of its parts (digital signatures, asymmetric cryptography, proof-of-work, etc.).
Governance is based on consensus instead of a single point of control â€“ both at the network level (majority consensus) and the transaction level (e.g., multi-sig).

*Blockchain technology*

While elements of the transaction verification and currency issuance mechanism are innovative in themselves (such as PoW/PoS/etc.), when used in the context of the blockchain, they implement a novel process of establishing the integrity of any transaction/record in a shared ledger.

**Positioning innovation: Who's defined as the possible customer?**

*Digital currencies*

Digital currencies are fixed in supply (at least in some implementations) and have built-in monetary policy features (although these might also be disadvantages).
Digital currencies are open source â€“ operational details of the protocol and participation in its development are accessible to everyone.
Digital currencies enable the borderless and trustless peer-to-peer exchange of financial value.

*Blockchain technology*

Decentralized governance, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), and autonomous economic agents (even distributed autonomous organizations) redefine what is possible in terms of internet applications, new venture funding, and even commerce.

**Paradigm innovation: changes in the underlying mental and business models**

*Digital currencies*

Digital currencies include programmable means of exchange (multisig, timelock, etc.), thus supporting the creation of the world's first programmable money (money-over-IP). In addition, digital currencies enable machine-to-machine financial communication.

*Blockchain technology*

Blockchain-based applications enable distributed consensus over a shared ledger for the first time in history, thereby embedding trust in internet communication.
Digital currencies may provide the basis for autonomous economic agents and human-less corporations (DAOs). This can unleash a whole new era of machine-to-machine (M2M) commerce.

**Platform innovation: Relatively new and includes network effects**

*Digital currencies & Blockchain technology*

Platforms are powerful ways to diffuse innovations, by creating an infrastructure upon which other creations can be built, even outside company boundaries (innovation crowdsourcing). Think, for example, about Ethereum as platform innovation (ERC20 tokens, Dapps, etc.). 
While digital currencies are perhaps the basis for many instances of Product / Process / Position / Paradigm innovation, the blockchain may be best conceptualized as a Platform Innovation.
