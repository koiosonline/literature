# BC-3.3.2.5 Smart contract life cycle

From source [Life Cycle Of Smart Contract Development]( https://medium.com/quillhash/life-cycle-of-smart-contract-development-8929fa073b7f)


1.	Understand the use-case of smart contract.
2.	Create a basic architecture of smart contracts interaction or flowchart how functions will interact with each other.
3.	Start development using any IDE or development tools like Truffle, remix with proper documentation of each and every function.
4.	Once the development is completed start testing smart contracts on test-net or private blockchain.(this is called a manual testing).
5.	Record all the transaction while testing on test-net, analyze results of all transactions with actual use case or business logic of smart contract.
6.	Unit testing will be the next step in smart contract development life cycle, there are multiple frameworks for unit and integration testing that can be used to test smart contract. Example : Truffle framework.
7.	Once unit testing is done using truffle framework on ganache, smart contract author should go for 3rd party Audit of smart contract.
8.	Last but not the least, bug bounty programs are also very efficient to secure smart contracts. Communities like 0x protocol is offering $100,000 in bounty programs.
