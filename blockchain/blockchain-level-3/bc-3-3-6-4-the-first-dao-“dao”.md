# BC-3.3.6.4 The first DAO, called “DAO”

The year 2016 was perhaps marked the most by the shocking initial success of a DAO called „The DAO“, that later tragically ended due to a security hole. The DAO was made by company Slock.it that focuses on Internet-Of-Things solutions and it was an attempt to decentralize as many things as possible, even the mother company that would fund IoT products.

The idea was that as crowdfunding made investing for smaller players easier, it was also more dangerous, not the least because of lack of risk management done by smaller investors, and that this could be solved by transparent, automated smart contracts.

The DAO contract would accept investments in ether and exchange them for DAO tokens, that investors would use for voting on offered project proposals.

Its legal status was undefined and it remains unclear even now. Since The DAO was not a legal entity in any jurisdiction, any litigation or tax liabilities were problematic. It stood as „code is law“ (the disclaimer explicitly mentioned that the code has priority over anything else), therefore any disputes were supposed to be resolved by interacting with the smart contract itself, through the functionalities that it provided.
