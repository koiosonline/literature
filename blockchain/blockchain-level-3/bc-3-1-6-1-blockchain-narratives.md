# BC-3.1.6.1 Blockchain Narratives 

Because "software is eating the world," our data is getting increasingly more essential and abundant. We could go in multiple directions from here. However, the most exciting stuff we'll build on this new foundational blockchain layer probably hasn't been invented yet. 

So let's take a look at what gen pop thinks about how the future of blockchains might look like and how this perspective is continuously changing (examples Bitcoin & Ethereum). 


## Bitcoin narratives
In the chart below, [Nick Carter]( https://medium.com/@nic__carter/visions-of-bitcoin-4b7b7cbcd24c) weighted these various narratives according to their popularity at the time.

[Definitely read the article!](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/visions-of-bitcoin-4b7b7cbcd24c)

The article concludes: In the end, a healthy respect for Bitcoin history is a necessary starting point of any attempt to define it. It is not unitary, and Bitcoiners are not ideologically homogenous. Bitcoin contains multitudes, and it's important to remind ourselves of that." 


## Ethereum narratives

Bitcoin is not the only public blockchain out there anymore. Other public blockchains, like Ethereum, offer different tradeoffs. It allows more flexibility, creating different use-cases. So the question "what is the future for Bitcoin?" can be changed to "what is the future for open public blockchains?". 

*"When [‚Ä¶] bitcoin began, the anonymous wizard desired to test two parameters- a trustless, decentralized database [‚Ä¶] and a robust transaction system capable of sending value across the world without intermediaries. Yet the past five years have painfully demonstrated a third missing feature: a sufficiently powerful Turing-complete scripting language."*‚Äî Vitalik, Official Ethereum.org website, 2013‚Äì14. 

>üí° Keynote: many more narratives might be added in the future! Let's take a closer look at the narratives for Ethereum to expand your vision a bit.

## Our picks

We originated from the program "Finance & Control" and research center "New Finance" @ THUAS. A goal is to research how new technologies impact our society, focusing on Finance and the educational sector. Hence we chose the following narratives to focus on in this program: 


1. Sound money

2. Web3 

3. Open Finance
