# BC-3.2.3.8 A new type of risk of centralized exchanges

1.	Fiat on-ramps (Coinbase, Gemini) – regulated with KYC / AML procedures.
2.	“Altcoin casino’s” (Binance) - unregulated 
3.	P2p exchanges / DEXes

Commonly formulated main risks: Hacks. Infamous example: [Mount Gox hack]( https://blockonomi.com/mt-gox-hack/ )(70% of BTC-transactions worldwide in 2014). 740,000 bitcoins (6% of all bitcoin in existence at the time) were valued at the equivalent of €460 million and over $3 billion at October 2017 prices. An additional $27 million was missing from the company’s bank accounts. Although 200,000 bitcoins were eventually recovered, the remaining 650,000 have never been recovered. Another example: the Korean Debacle (delisting exchanges & panic selling) [Source]( https://fortune.com/2018/01/08/coinmarketcap-removes-korean-exchange-prices/?source=post_elevate_sequence_page---------------------------)

So what’s the issue here? The chief problem is the interplay between rankings sites, exchanges, and issuers, especially as it relates to exchange volume. It goes like this:
Issuers want to list on liquid markets and exit or pump their positions
1.	Token issuers want liquid markets
2.	Exchanges pretend to be liquid (listing fees) 
3.	Unregulated and unmonitored exchanges 
4.	Wash trading for increasing volume 
5.	Rankings monetize through ref links/ads (no monitor resources) 
6.	Wash trading sites gain in ranking ([fake volume]( https://medium.com/@sylvainartplayribes/chasing-fake-volume-a-crypto-plague-ea1a3c1e0b5e))
7.	Exchanges, ranking site, and token issuer profit
8.	Investors lose in long term

“So not only was CoinMarketCap, the largest and most popular aggregator, guilty of enabling scams by accepting payment for banner ads, in some cases, they monetized them with affiliate links within the banner ads themselves.” [Source]( https://twitter.com/bccponzi/status/927497536696438784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext%252Fhtml%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07%26schema%3Dtwitter%26url%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fbccponzi%2Fstatus%2F927497536696438784%26image%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage%253Furl%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fpbs.twimg.com%25252Fmedia%25252FDN8htohWAAAaU_-.jpg%25253Alarge%2526key%253Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)
