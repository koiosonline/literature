# BC-3.1.3.6 The value capture phase (part 2: Bitcoin adoption)

## How far is bitcoin in this adoption process? 

It seems to be in the very beginning of the adoption curve (outdated map, though):

A map of bitcoin legality shows similar tendencies and exceptions like Russia, where bitcoin usage is prohibited (but is one of the more active countries with users).

## Examples of challenges 
To reach mass adoption, there are many challenges up ahead. Here is a [quick overview]( https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-adoption-challenges/) of several of the more commonly known challenges:

## Narratives 

About Bitcoin adoption, it all depends on the use-case (adoption as sound money or, f.e., as a value-sharing protocol). It is a repeated cycle of hypes & bursts, all put in an S-curve, based on the adoption. Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) can perhaps be seen as the first “byeable” S-curve, reflecting its price. Not on a day-by-day basis, of course, but spread over a more extended period.

Technology and markets co-evolve, where suppliers and customers co-determine. But remember: customers do not buy technologies; they buy products! Technologists are typically concerned with developing Hardware/software. Marketing must create products out of these. Marketing for consumers is very different from marketing for businesses (e.g., lock-in relationships with suppliers may significantly increase switching costs; retail penetration affects adoption decisions). It is easy to spot a not working technology. Try to do the same with a product (products may fail due to inadequate logistics, poor branding, insufficient customer training, inappropriate marketing, competitive dynamics, and many more reasons). Attempting to differentiate a technological product based on functionality or performance can be expensive and futile – it is necessary to identify why a potential customer might look for an alternative to existing solutions. 

**When applied to Bitcoin, technological infrastructures like the protocol and blockchain-based database are not what (most) users are interested in. They want to see the outcomes, workable products**. Luckily for Bitcoin- and blockchain enthusiasts, many different teams and projects are working very hard behind the scenes to launch user-friendly services. A current example is the Lightning Network, which later more in this session. [See here a working instance of Lightning]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fb6Xww2P7c&feature=emb_logo).
