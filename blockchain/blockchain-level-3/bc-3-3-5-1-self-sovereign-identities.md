# BC-3.3.5 Governance by a blockchain based infrastructure – SSI


## About this chapter?
To build reputation based systems or other futuristic governance systems it is of the utmost importance that you create freedom for the individuals using the infrastructure. Enable them to own their data and form their own digital identity. Welcome to one of our first community tracks and one the key elements of future societies: digital self-sovereign identities. 

## What will we discuss? 

BC-3.3.5.1 Self-sovereign identities 

BC-3.3.5.2 Project Urbit

BC-3.3.5.3 And how about an identity on KOIOS?

BC-3.3.5.4 Self-sovereign identity – our first community track! 


## After this class, I can:

* Explain how blockchain could enable SSI-systems (understand)

* Explain the differences and similarities of SSI- and REP-based systems (understand) 

* Evaluate how a SSI-system could play a role in the ecosystem of KOIOS (evaluate)

## Project Urbit

[Urbit ID]( https://urbit.org/understanding-urbit/
) is an identity and authentication system specifically designed to work with Urbit OS. When you boot or log in to Urbit OS, you use your Urbit ID.

Your Urbit ID is a short, memorable name (like ~ravmel-ropdyl) that’s a username, network address and crypto wallet all in one. It’s registered on a blockchain, you own it with a key and no one can take it away from you. Urbit IDs are cryptographic property.

Urbit IDs aren’t money, but they are scarce, so each one costs something. This means that when you meet a stranger on the Urbit network, they have some skin in the game and are less likely to be a bot or a spammer.
The Urbit ID system is live and deployed, and we don’t plan to change it all that much. It works well. If you’re curious to dive further into the details, jump ahead to this post.
