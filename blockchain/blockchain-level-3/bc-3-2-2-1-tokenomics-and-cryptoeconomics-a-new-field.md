# BC-3.2.2.1 Tokenomics & Cryptoeconomics: a new field?

Cryptoeconomics refers to the combinations of cryptography, computer networks, and game theory which provide secured and decentralized systems exhibiting some set of economic dis/incentives. But Tokenomics. Cryptoeconomics. I See Words. [What Do They Mean?]( https://www.he3labs.com/blog/2018/6/4/what-is-tokenomics) 

## Definition
Token economics essentially refers to the study, design, and implementation of economic systems based on blockchain technology. Every blockchain platform and blockchain application has its token economic model. The subject of token economics focuses on the actual, new economic models that are created through cryptocurrencies. This excludes tokens solely used for fundraising and play no significant role in its underlying platform as they do not pose new models. 

There is one assumption on which nearly all token economic models are based: people act upon incentives. This is based on incentive theory, a human behavioral theory that assumes the behavior is motivated by a desire for reinforcement or incentives. In token economics, these incentives are the tokens themselves. They are used to motivate network members to behave to the benefit of the network. Act according to the rules of the network, and you’re awarded cryptocurrencies. So the rules of a network must be set so that people contribute to the entire network because of personal incentives. People want more money, and they get more money by doing what’s best for the network.

These incentives are mostly financial incentives because tokens have a financial value. This financial value stems from the money that has been invested in specific cryptocurrencies in an ICO and on the crypto exchanges.
