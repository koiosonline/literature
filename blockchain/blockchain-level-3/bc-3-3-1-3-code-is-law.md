# BC-3.3.1.3 Code is law? 

As you have seen in level 1, we interact with each other in many different ways, and sometimes value is transferred within those interactions. Some of those interactions are actual agreements, like buying a car, and some are hypothetical agreements (like when you drive that car, you won't run a red light). Of course, we can bundle these kinds of contracts in all different categories, like corporate contracts. Still, a famous type of contract is a "social contract" (waiting for red light is an example of such a social contract). 


>ðŸ’¡  A [social contract is]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) where an actual or hypothetical agreement among the members of an organized society or between a community and its ruler is defined and limits the rights and duties of each.

## Wet code and dry code

>ðŸ’¡ Before you continue, please read [source]( https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html)

There's a strong distinction to be made between "wet code," interpreted by the brain, and "dry code," interpreted by computers. Human-read media is wet code, whereas computer code and computer-readable files (to the extent a computer deals meaningfully with them) are "dry code." Law is wet code, interpreted by those on whom the law is imposed, and interpreted (often somewhat differently) by law enforcers, but most authoritatively (and even more differently) interpreted by judges. Human language is mostly wet code, but to the extent, computer programs crudely translate from one language to another, keyword-ad programs parse text to make an educated guess as to what ads a user will most likely click. So on, human language text can also be dry code. Traditional contracts are wet code, whereas [smart contracts]( http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue2_9/szabo/index.html) are mostly dry code. [Secure property titles]( http://szabo.best.vwh.net/securetitle.html ) and the [domain name system]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS) are mostly dry code.

>ðŸ’¡  Social contracts and other contracts can be enforced by human institutions (human interpretations), known as "wet" (brain = wet). Like our legal institutions. But they can also be enforced by computers/networks (mathematically enforced), known as "dry" (no human brain involved in enforcing), like a blockchain protocol. 

As you can imagine, wet and dry code can mix some things up! For example, a developer writes dry code to do A, but instead, somebody interprets it as doing B. 
A famous example of battles of governance is the fork of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, where somebody exactly followed the dry code (and acted according to dry law) and ran away with huge amounts of ether (which wasn't, of course, the intention, according to human institutions). [Further short reading: code is the law not quite yet](https://www.coindesk.com/code-is-law-not-quite-yet).
When Ethereum was trading at around $20, The DAO launched an Ethereum-based ICO, raising about $150m (in Ether). Then, virtually all of the Ether raised (representing about 15% of the outstanding ETH supply) was plumbed by an anonymous coder who exploited a wrinkle in The DAO's "smart contract" â€” making off with a nice 3.6 million ETH.
At today's price of ~ $300 = 1 ETH, the smart contractor behind the gambit earned a cool $1 billion on The DAO's supposedly "smart" contract.
