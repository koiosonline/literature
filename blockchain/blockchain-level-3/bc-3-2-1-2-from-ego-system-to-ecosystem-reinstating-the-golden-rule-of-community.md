## Decentralisation & commons
So once more… **Why is decentralisation so important?** Although the current form isn’t perfect, the genie is out of the bottle and we strive towards decentralised data. Essential because of the data driven society, with upcoming data consuming techniques like Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT). Interesting possibilities, but do you really want centralised parties in control those scenario’s with a centralised blockchain ledger as a monitoring tool?

Regarding public blockchains: It all comes to building for the “commons”. Whether this is freedom of the individual, for example creating an escape from an Orwellian future, or creating new forms of public goods and services, like web 3,0, with nearly free or free transaction cost. 
Because for example money isn’t inflated, consumerism & growth are pillars of the “old economy”, which makes room for new economies based on principals like sustainability, sharing and we can even start Universal Basic Income experiments.

## Network effects

Network effects are an emergent property that occur when: A product or service becomes more valuable to its existing users as more people use it. There are a few different kinds of network effects:

**Direct network effects** work because existing users gain the option to interact with an increasing number of people as the underlying product/service is adopted. Basically all closed-loop communication networks exhibit this type of network effect, including Internet-based services such as Facebook and Whatsapp.

** Indirect Network Effects** — increased usage of the product spawns the production of increasingly valuable complementary goods, which results in an increase in the value of the original product. Operating systems (OS) are the most famous type of product that benefit from indirect network effects. App developers are drawn to build on an OS to reach consumers; by building an app for a given OS, that OS becomes more attractive to new consumers, creating a larger market for future app developers.

** Two Sided Network Effects** — increases in usage by one set of users increases the value of a complementary product to another distinct set of users, and vice versa. Some famous examples include eBay, Uber and Lyft, AirBnB, and Amazon’s marketplace business. In each of these networks, consumers benefit from more choice and competition among suppliers, which drives more consumers, which attracts more suppliers.

** Data Network Effects** — when a product, generally powered by machine learning, becomes smarter as it acquires more data users. Data network effects occur in most modern cloud-based apps today, though their relative strengths vary widely by use case and sophistication.
