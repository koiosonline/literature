# BC-.3.2.3.1 What are cryptocurrencies?

Let’s start with understanding the [definition of cryptocurrencies]( https://masterthecrypto.com/what-is-cryptocurrency/). Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that are encrypted (secured) using cryptography. It is important to note that all coins or tokens are regarded as cryptocurrencies, even if most coins do not function as a currency or medium of exchange. The term cryptocurrency is a misnomer since a currency technically represents a unit of account, value store, and exchange medium. 
All these characteristics are inherent within Bitcoin, and since Bitcoin's creation kickstarted the cryptocurrency space, any other coins conceived after Bitcoin are generally considered as a cryptocurrency. However, most do not fulfill the characteristics above of an actual currency. The most common categorization of cryptocurrencies are: 

•	Alternative Cryptocurrency Coins (Altcoins)

•	Tokens

## Altcoins & tokens?
The native currency of all other blockchains other than Bitcoin is called Altcoins. 
Some of those blockchains & native altcoins find their origin in Bitcoin (Litecoin), and others are completely different (Ethereum). Besides having a native altcoin as a currency to perform transactions on their network, many platforms also offer the possibility of creating an additional token on their platform that represents a certain service, an asset, or some transferable right. They often facilitate a Dapp. So, for example, Ethereum has the (native) altcoin Ether and all kinds of different tokens.

The main difference between altcoins and tokens is in their structure; altcoins are separate currencies with their separate blockchain, while tokens operate on top of a blockchain that facilitates the creation of decentralized applications.

Most coins in existence (close to 80%) are tokens since they're much easier to create.
