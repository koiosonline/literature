# BC-3.2.3.2 The main categories

The terminology "cryptocurrency" seems to be slightly off because many coins and tokens serve a different additional role besides being a transactional coin (currency). The main categories are:

1. To support transactions of value = Transactional coins = Bitcoin or another altcoin

2. To support transaction on the platform/network = Platform coin = Ether or another altcoin

3. To support services or Dapps = Utility token = OmiseGo or other tokens 

4. Security token = asset-backed

5. To support fundraising = Security token = a grey area!

## Another category: the "futility" tokens ðŸ˜‰ 

In short: A futility token is an already-existing token that has no chance at accruing future value due to its poor design. The users are still delusional, the company may or may not be aware of the token's problems, and general ecosystem participants are becoming aware of the flaws in the design of payment tokens. There is no future for these types of tokens other than a dramatic change in the direction of its ecosystem and functionality â€” or an outright conversion to security. Note more about actual value capture later on, in chapter "3.2.4 token design".
