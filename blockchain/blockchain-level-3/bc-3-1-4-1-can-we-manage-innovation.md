# BC-3.1.4.1 Can we manage innovation? 


## Innovation management is a learned capability

Skills can be acquired and applied to the successful execution of the innovation process. For example, you can learn how to innovate an organization (or yourself, for that matter!). But how to acquire and manage such a skill? The primary innovation process can be applied to a range of situations. Some we already discussed in the different types of innovation, for example, regarding product innovation where signals need to be picked up from the market. Important to realize is that, although common issues exist, each situation requires careful assessment. Simply copying ideas from elsewhere is not enough. Thoughts and best practices must be adapted to suit particular circumstances. You could say that a contingency theory applies. It is an organizational theory that claims that there is no best way to organize a corporation, lead a company, or make decisions. Instead, the optimal course of action is contingent (dependent) upon the internal and external situation. A contingent leader effectively applies their style of leadership to the right situation.

And this is a quest, of which once again many models are suited. We will help you find your innovation mindset in the next part, but let’s start with some general examples of profiles of innovation models applied to companies. ** Context is critical**. 

Choosing the suitable innovation model for your company is all about context. Industry context matters because only a subset of models can succeed in most industries. Some models are better suited to—and increase shareholder value in—specific industries and sectors than others.

## A contingency model
Innovation management is a learned capability. But, each situation is different. Influences around which the generic innovation process can be configured. Innovation practice will be different across the sector, size, systems, and scope:


Sector: different characteristics and priorities (e.g., speed of change, scale-intensity) 


Size: small firms innovate differently from larger ones. Smaller companies enjoy advantages but need to institutionalize formal processes.

**Systems**: countries and regions may have more or less supportive contexts regarding policies, funding, tax treatment, etc. Innovation is nowadays much less of a single-company activity. It is increasingly a multi-player game in which companies work together in networks. These may be regional clusters (see Silicon Valley), supply chains (University/market synergies), strategic alliances (Cross-industry (IBM/Samsung). Or cultural collaborations (like in Korea, Japan, et al.). One of the critical implications is that we need to shift our thinking to a systems view (!) Including a wide range of actors, such as customers and suppliers, competitors, the government, educators, etc.

**Scope**: innovation management may differ in incremental vs. disruptive innovation, as well as in cases of social innovation. Companies will benefit from participation in innovation networks and clusters. 

Social innovation plays a distinct role in developing new platforms and paradigms. “Social entrepreneurs are not content to give a fish or teach how to fish. They will not rest until they have revolutionized fishing” Bill Drayton, founder of Ashoka, a global non-profit devoted to social entrepreneurship. Not all innovation is (directly) about making money – at least, as a stated initial intention. Think of Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web (or Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin?). Social entrepreneurship starts from a mission to create some form of social value. That is not to say that money can’t be a by-product of this process for the social entrepreneur! Social entrepreneurship can prove to be an excellent vehicle for platform innovation by creating the infrastructure needed for other (profit-oriented) innovations to build upon. 

## Different types of entrepreneurs

**Darwinians**: Concerned with competing and creating business success.

**Communitarians**: concerned with social identities relating to community participation/contribution.

**Missionaries**: those with a strong inner vision – a desire to change the world.


## Can we manage innovation?
Ok, innovation is important – But, is it manageable? Can something so complex and uncertain be subject to systematic management? Although there are no easy recipes, we may find an underlying pattern of success. Not by designing and running a complex but predictable mechanism. But, by creating conditions to maximize the likelihood of successful outcomes from an overly complicated process. 

Success seems to be based on two key ingredients:
Resource availability and allocation *
Management capabilities of the organization (routines)

* An example of resource allocation is given in the video on koios.online. Applied on the Koios platform. 

So about managing capabilities. Organizations develop, over time, embedded patterns of behaving: 
Result of repetition and reinforcement, ‘the way we do things around here. These patterns reflect an underlying set of shared beliefs and form part of the organization’s culture. Think about Google’s culture, Apple’s culture, Toyota’s culture. **Routines emerge from repeated experimentation and experience. In other words, culture is learned (but takes time!). Over time, it becomes embedded and triggers automatic responses to particular situations (routines). This does not mean that routines do not require detailed conscious thought and constant adaptation. Just think about the analogy of driving a car. **

Some routines are better than others. So, is it possible (and essential) to learn from others (best practice transfer)? Keeping in mind that patterns are firm-specific and that blindly copying them rarely works. **Successful innovation management is about building and improving effective routines:** 


Not all firms can do that equally. We can identify four types of firms in terms of innovation capability (see below): 

* **Type A: Unaware** (not able to pick up signals quickly; unconscious of the need to change) 

* **Type B: Reactive ** (able to respond to the external threats, but not to create opportunities) 

* **Type C: Strategic** (capable of executing a strategy of continuous innovation; unprepared for disruptive). 

* **Type D: Creative** (proactive approach to building and sustaining competitive advantage)



## Successful innovation management

Research has highlighted aspects of successful innovation management:

Successful innovation correlates strongly with how a company selects and manages projects (e.g., being able to introduce new products faster than others brings a competitive advantage)

Blockchains tend to create markets with substantial first-mover advantages, coupled with multi-sided network effects (i.e., the more users/developers/merchants, the more valuable a product offering). **Being first to market is crucial – hence, fast and robust project selection and management are imperative**. Successful innovation needs integrated management, not partial development of abilities (e.g., strong R&D is not enough; links to market are also crucial). 

**Distributed technologies rely as much on acceptance/adoption as on technology invention. Companies need to combine strong technical skills with superior market access (easier said than done!).**

>💡Successful innovation needs processes of constant learning and adaptation. 

 
 
>💡 Digital Currencies & DLT applications are fast-moving markets; think of the experience of early exchanges and others that failed to learn and adapt – expect lots of failures, repeated boom-and-bust cycles

## Characteristics of a learning organization

A learning organization will:
* Exercise effective knowledge management & IPR protection
* Implement processes for continuous experimentation and structured reflection
* Insist on formal processes and proper documentation
* Set targets and continuously measure achievement 
* Display and disseminate results – internally and externally 
* Place emphasis on people’s training and development

>💡 Emphasize people’s training and development
