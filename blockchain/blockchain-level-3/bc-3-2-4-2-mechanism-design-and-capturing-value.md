# BC-3.2.4.2 Mechanism design & capturing value

The challenge is open-source projects like Linux and other (eco)systems as well, no matter the amount of (de) centralization: how do you come to a system where value Creation = Value Capture? In other words: how do you capture value when you create/contribute to the ecosystem? 

This also requires a fundamental shift of thinking for designers of these systems. Where you could previously create a “company” that would collect the value, we are now designing entire systems on the macro level. 

>💡 That means that instead of the value proposition for an organization, you now need to look for a value proposition for different actors/entities/agents in your network. Furthermore, it would help if you designed it so that when these agents create value for themselves, they create value for the entire ecosystem. 

The best token projects focus on tokens to build network effects and help govern the network. An interesting read in that regard is [this article](https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/funding-the-evolution-of-blockchains-87d160988481) describing the funding of developers and the evolution of blockchains. In short: “So, perhaps the highest leverage thing protocol designers can do is think about how to engineer the evolutionary characteristics of their blockchains — specifically, the economic incentives for anyone to come along and improve them. The best-engineered organisms can outpace others, even if they start smaller or later.”.

>💡 Once again, to conclude: The central task in mechanism design is to specify a mechanism that incentivizes rational agents to behave in specific ways, based upon their private information, that lead to socially desired outcomes.
