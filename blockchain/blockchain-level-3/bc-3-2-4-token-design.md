# BC-3.2.4 Token design

## About this chapter?
Where the previous paragraph described the tokens, the “what”, to incentivize actors to contribute to their ecosystem, this paragraph describes the “how” of incentivization: token design. By designing the token economics in a certain way, we can steer actors to capture value for themselves and simultaneously for the entire ecosystem. Beautiful design systems that might support whole future societies, sometimes very simple in design like Bitcoin, but still incredibly hard to think off and bring to fruition on a global scale. The challenge we call token design! 

## What will we discuss? 

BC-3.2.4.1 Mechanism design - introduction

BC-3.2.4.2 Mechanism design & capturing value

BC-3.2.4.3 Initial token and token distribution


## By the end of this lesson, I can:

* Elaborate on how mechanism design is a reverse game theory concept (understand)

* Explain the central task of token design and why this is important for not only blockchain technology but possibly for future societies as well (understand)

* Design a simple token mechanism to incentivize individual actors that also benefits the ecosystem and apply them in my blockchain business plan (create) 

* Evaluate the goal effectiveness of design systems of three tokens of own choosing (evaluate)
