# BC-3.3.1.6 Why is good governance important? 


## Just one of the many micro examples out there ‚Äì the Bancor robbery 

[As discussed: many errors can happen if you don't get your governance in order](https://medium.com/orbs-network/the-great-bancor-robbery-and-what-we-should-learn-from-it-185a0a90afb4)

A form of disruptive innovation occurs when a cultural shift is combined with practical technology to scale the culture shift. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies have both of these properties. First, they are a cultural shift manifesting through helpful technology:
1.	We are in the midst of a global collapse of trust in institutions.
2.	Technologies (blockchain, digitally scarce coins, distributed consensus, etc.) that allow us to operate without these trusted intermediaries are now emerging and will enable us to reimagine a world without these intermediaries.
Amid crypto-mania, we believe it important to focus on the utility behind the hype: Blockchain is software that allows us to reimagine trusted intermediaries. Cryptocurrencies are one of the first killer applications. Cryptocurrencies are reimagining the world's most successful means to transmit trust: money.

[Blockchain Governance: Programming Our Future + examples]( https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/blockchain-governance-programming-our-future-c3bfe30f2d74)
With blockchains emerging as the new global infrastructure, we have the opportunity to create vastly different power structures and program the future we want for ourselves. 

Blockchains are unique because they 1) allow thousands of governance systems and monetary policies to be tried at the speed of software with 2), in some cases, much lower consequences of failure. As a result, there will be a [Cambrian explosion]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion) of economic and governance designs where many approaches will be tried in parallel at hyperspeed. To be clear, I include economic design and monetary policy (said another way, incentive structure) in governance because, like other aspects of the system, they can be modified as time passes. Through this process, blockchains may teach us more about governance in the next ten years than we have learned from the "real world" in the last 100 years.

## Two Critical Components of Governance

**1. Incentives**
Each group in the system has its incentives. Those incentives are not always 100% aligned with all other groups in the system. Groups will propose changes over time that are [advantageous for them]( https://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/natural-progress-things-spurious-quotation). Organisms are biased towards their survival. This commonly manifests in changes to the reward structure, monetary policy, or balances of power.

**2. Mechanisms for coordination**

Since it's unlikely all groups have 100% incentive alignment at all times, the ability for each group to coordinate around their common incentives is critical for them to affect change. If one group can coordinate better than another, it creates power imbalances in their favor.
In practice, a significant factor is how much coordination can be done on-chain vs. off-chain, where on-chain coordination makes coordinating easier. For example, in some new blockchains, on-chain coordination allows the rules or even the ledger history itself to be changed.

## "Why isn't Bitcoin banned everywhere?" 

Bitcoin was supposed to be the enemy of governments. It was supposed to destroy the state's monopoly on monetary "policy. It was supposed to be a battering ram against the banks and financial surveillance. Indeed, Bitcoin was supposed to erect nothing less than an uncensorable shadow financial system". [Source]( https://hackernoon.com/why-isnt-bitcoin-banned-everywhere-32a2caec90)

So why have governments ushered Bitcoin through the front door? Bottom line: bitcoin is not a threat as an SoV, but it will be as an MoE (and it currently doesn't look like that is going to happen soon). 

1.	Governments don't want to stem innovation (internet approach)? 
2.	Don't governments understand what's happening? 
3.	Not a threat: It is pseudonymous (behavior can still be tracked). To the uncritical eye, Bitcoin's pseudonymity looks like a radical step forward in economic privacy. But a facade of privacy is more dangerous than no privacy at all. The more safe and empowered citizens are convinced they are, the more the state is free to accrue real power over them. This is the first reason Bitcoin is sovereign-friendly.
4.	Not a threat: A store of value is not threatening. It's become increasingly clear how unlikely this is. This is both because Bitcoin cannot be a worldwide currency and can succeed without becoming that worldwide currency. Classically, a currency must act as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Will BTC be an MoE (scaling, rising dust limit, deflationary by nature/hold incentive)? If Bitcoin can become an MoE, no more regulated fiat ramp ones are needed. Why do China and India Ban ü°™ capital flight in another store of value other than their currency (already have gold import quotas) 
5.	Bitcoin is stateless ‚Äì thanks to Satoshi, Bitcoin belongs to no one and relies on no one. Different nations can align.

Because of the dramatically reduced friction for an exit, the need for compelling voice (governance) is more critical than ever. It is trivial to fork a blockchain and copy all of its code and state. So the value isn't in the chain of data. It's in the community and social consensus around a chain. Governance is what keeps societies together and, in turn, gives a token value.
"We are birthing into existing systems which transcend us. In the same way democracy and capitalism, as systems determine so much of the emergent behavior around us, blockchains will do the same with even greater reach. These systems are organisms which take on [lives of their own]( http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). They are more concerned with [perpetuating themselves]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence) than the individuals which comprise them. As technology stretches these systems to their limits, the implications become more pronounced. So we'd be wise to consider the structure of these systems while we can carefully. Like any new powerful technology, blockchains are a tool that can go in many different directions. Used well, we can create a world with greater prosperity and freedom. Used poorly, we can develop systems that lead us to places we didn't intend to go.
