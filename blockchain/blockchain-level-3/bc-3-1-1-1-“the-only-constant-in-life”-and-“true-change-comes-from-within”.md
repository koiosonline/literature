# BC 3.1.1.1 Change is the only constant in life

Change has been among us for quite some time and has inspired many wise men before us. Here is a short selection from gentlemen that roamed the earth thousands of years ago: 

*‚ÄúThe Only Thing That Is Constant Is Change‚Äù* ‚Äï [Heraclitus]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus)

*‚Äú To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often‚Äù* ‚Äì [Winston Churchill ]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill)

*‚Äú They must often change, who would be constant in happiness or wisdom‚Äù* - [Confucius]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordi-jansen-19797742/)

>üí° Change is an essential factor in our life and always has been. So you need to be able to deal with that will you want to make change work for you.

As you might find after a web search is that we still differ in definitions and perspectives of change after thousands of years. This isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing, but we drew the following conclusions: 

* Change has some general characteristics, which you can describe in different ways 

* Change can be experienced in multiple levels and forms. One of them is personal. 


## Education in 2050 
We, as lecturers, are interested in change because we need to help students find their way in a continuously changing world. A very interesting read on how continuous change might impact the educational systems is [this article]( https://www.wired.co.uk/article/yuval-noah-harari-extract-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century) from Harari. Our aim at Koios is to integrate one of the core messages from this article: 

*‚ÄúSo what should we be teaching? Many pedagogical experts argue that schools should switch to teaching ‚Äúthe four Cs‚Äù ‚Äì critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity‚Äù.*

To start with this, we can offer you guidance with tools, methods, and mentors to take a deep dive within yourself and find your core elements. High-level examples: 

[HBDI]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Instrument): profiling for communication / thinking preferences 

[HEXACO]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEXACO_model_of_personality_structure):  a model for human personality 

Watch the video to see a short explanation of these models applied to your lecturer of today. Keep in mind that these are basic models. We are always looking for better ways and methods that suit the needs of our students. We have only scratched the surface of the personal development iceberg, so suggestions and tips are more than welcome! 

## Change is personal
One of the conclusions of these methods is that everybody copes and reacts differently in situations. Some cope easily with change, and others need time to adjust or don‚Äôt want to adjust at all. There is no right or wrong. Sometimes not adjusting might be a perfect fit. In another situation, it might end up very poorly for a person. With personal development, you can find your path and personal preferences, which also help you better understand others around you.  It helps assess different situations and consider different approaches.
