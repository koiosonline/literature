The main messages of the Global Innovation Index 2019 can be summarized in seven key findings (full download [here](https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/about-gii)): 

1: Amid economic slowdown, innovation is blossoming around the world; but new obstacles pose risks to global innovation

2: Shifts in the global innovation landscape are materializing; some middle-income economies are on the rise

3: Innovation inputs and outputs are still concentrated in very few economies; a global innovation divide persists

4: Some economies get more return on their innovation investments than others

5: Shifting focus from innovation quantity to innovation quality remains a priority

6: Most top science and technology clusters are in the U.S., China, and Germany; Brazil, India, Iran, the Russian Federation, and Turkey also make the top 100 list

7: Creating healthy lives through medical innovation requires more investment in innovation and increased diffusion efforts

## Final note
So now you understand that change is one of the accelerators for innovation and that innovation is not only seeing opportunities by connecting dots but also acting on them. You have also learned how to start when you want to perform. 

Base your strategy upon: 

* The category (do you want incremental or disruptive innovation?)

* The type of innovation to apply (gain insight in which type by using practical models like the Doblin’s or the P’s).

* By doing so, you will bring focus to the table. Your options of possible actions drop precipitously, providing the clarity that can lead to action. 

* If you don’t oversee all the different types of innovation, don’t despair, and stick with this overview:
