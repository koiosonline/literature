# BC-3.1.3.5 The value capture phase

## Phase 4: Value capture (how will we get the benefits from it?) 

**Generate returns; protect gains from the competition; achieve learning for future endeavors. Focus on CULTURE. **

Technological maturity and market maturity co-determine the influence on new product development. As a result, there are often four categories used (once again plotted in the matrix): 


1. **Differentiated**: both technology and markets are mature. New products are incremental innovations and may differentiate on pricing, features, support, etc.


2. **Architectural**: Existing technologies are applied to new markets. New products address specific target segments (market niches). Innovation is typically user-led or co-developed.


3. **Technological**: New technologies emerge to satisfy existing customer needs. New products differentiate on performance or cost/performance ratio.


4. **Complex**: Both technologies and markets are novel and co-evolved. Novel technologies are implemented, which, over time, help create novel applications previously un-thought of or impossible to develop.

## Introducing the famous S-curve

One of the theories to help you with this question is the diffusion of innovations (the ‚ÄúS-curve‚Äù). Throughout the 20th century, every major mass-market technology near-universally adopted has exhibited some form of an S-curve, as indicated in the chart below. 

>üí° Moreover, S-curves are becoming more compressed as technology advances, leading to more pronounced vertical growth adoption phases.

Innovations do not always translate into market successes. Typical factors affecting innovation diffusion:
* **Economic**: personal costs vs. social benefits; insufficient incentives

* **Behavioral**: priorities; inertia; risk propensity/aversion 

* **Organizational**: goals; routines; power and influence; culture 

* **Structural**: infrastructure; governance

When they do, innovations tend to diffuse across society in a typical **logistic (S-shaped) curve**.

## Diffusion of innovations 

[Diffusion of innovations ]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations)is a theory that seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate new ideas and technology spread. Rogers proposes that four main elements influence the spread of a new concept: the innovation itself, communication channels, time, and a social system. This process relies heavily on **human capital**. 

Other factors influencing adoption: 

* **Relative Advantage**: The degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the product it supersedes. 

* **Compatibility**: The degree to which an innovation is perceived to be consistent with existing experiences and needs of customers

* **Complexity**: The degree to which an innovation is perceived to be difficult to understand or use 

* **Trialability**: The degree to which an innovation can be experimented with on a limited (trial) basis 

* **Observability**: The degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others

The innovation must be widely adopted to self-sustain. Within the adoption rate, there is a point at which an innovation reaches critical mass (> 14%). The categories of adopters are innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards [based on technology adoption life cycle]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle)

**Forecasting and the S-curve become misleading**. They ask wrong questions and track incorrect data. Markets for disruptive technologies do not exist ‚Äì so, they cannot be analyzed or forecast. It is a process of trial-and-error versus selection, systematic experimentation, and learning. One organization that focuses on forecasting and making predictions is [Gartner]( https://www.gartner.com/en). They made the following predictions in 2018 for blockchain business and combined it with the so-called [hype cycle]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle):
