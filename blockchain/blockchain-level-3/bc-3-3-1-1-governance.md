# BC-3.1.1 Blockchain governance

## About this chapter?
This paragraph will break down governance and blockchain governance. Then, we will reflect on decentralization, whether true decentralization exists, and the importance of concepts like wet and dry code. Finally, we close by describing the importance of good governance on the micro and macro level. 

## What will we discuss? 

BC-3.3.1.1 Governance

BC-3.3.1.2 Different types of governance 

BC-3.3.1.3 Code is law?

BC-3.3.1.4 Introducing blockchain governance

BC-3.3.1.5 Does decentralization even exists? 

BC-3.3.1.6 Why is good governance important? 

BC-3.3.1.7 And how about governing KOIOS?

## After this class, I can:

1.	Explain in my own words what governance is (understand) 
2.	Illustrate how dry and wet code relate to blockchain governance (analyze) 
3.	Explain what is meant by the philosophy ‚Äúcode is law‚Äù (understand) 
4.	Describe the different elements of blockchain governance (understand) 
5.	Evaluate and support in what amount decentralization exists in current blockchain infrastructures (evaluate) 
6.	Argue why good governance is vital on micro and macro level (evaluate) 
7.	Challenge: Formulate new quantifying methods to measure decentralization (create)






# BC-3.3.1.1 Governance

>üí° Like government, the word governance derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb kubernaein [kubern√°o] (meaning to steer, the metaphorical sense first being attested in Plato). Generally, governance is about decisions that ultimately affect people (people called ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù).

Governance comprises all of the processes of governing ‚Äì whether undertaken by the government of a state, by a market or by a network ‚Äì over a social system (family, tribe, formal or informal organization, a territory or across territories) and whether through the laws, norms, power or language of an organized society. It relates to "the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of social norms and institutions". In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions. 

A variety of entities (known generically as governing bodies) can govern. The most formal is a government, a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given geopolitical system (such as a state) by establishing laws.
Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and held accountable [Source]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance)
