#BC-3.4.2 (de)centralized exchanges

## About this chapter?
Now that we have discussed the global transfer and settlement of payments, we can now analyze the transfer and settlement of other value types like assets and such. Once again, we start with describing the conventional systems and, secondly, dive into the decentralized variants. 

## What will we discuss? 
3.4.2.1	Centralised trading and settlement 
3.4.2.2	Decentralised trading and settlement

## After this class, I can:
1. Compare centralized and decentralized trading systems

 . 


# BC-3.4.2.2 Decentralized trading and settlement


## Centralized Bitcoin Exchanges	

Imagine you were an equity trader and used a Stock Exchange to trade between equities and cash and back. What would happen if they unexpectedly filed for bankruptcy? How much money would you stand to lose? The answer is zero. You would lose nothing. Your equities would be safe at your custodian bank, and your cash would be wherever you left it.
However, if you were a Bitcoin trader and your Bitcoin exchange went bankrupt, you could have lost everything – as users of Mt.Gox discovered to their surprise in 2014.
How can this be? Isn’t Bitcoin supposed to be the ultimate decentralized financial system? Well, yes, the Bitcoin network is decentralized, but many of the major players are not. And, worse, exchanges like Mt.Gox acted as more than just exchanges: they are also the Bitcoin custodian, clearinghouse, and bank.”

Today: More than 99% of cryptocurrency transactions go through centralized exchanges (Sexer, 2018). Examples: Bithumb, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Coinbase, GDAX, Gemini, Poloniex, Kraken.
Centralized Bitcoin Exchanges may soon become obsolete. See [Bitcoin exchanges are more centralized than traditional exchanges](http://gendal.me/2014/03/02/bitcoin-exchanges-are-more-centralised-than-traditional-exchanges-we- can-do-so-much-better-than-this/

## Risks of centralized exchanges

* Insecure – the risk of fund loss as they attract criminals Lack of liquidity compared to traditional markets Fragmented market

* Lack of transparency of costs of trading

## Decentralized exchanges 	

** Note that this session is a bit outdated. We are explaining the most recent developments in classes.** 

Are a specialized version of decentralized marketplaces. Advantages of decentralized markets: 

* Cost-effectiveness – lower fees, peer-to-peer payments, no chargeback fraud, easy to deploy

* Unconstrained policies – sellers and buyers agree to the terms on their own, or they can select from a broader array of options

* Flexible branding – the seller, can customize the looks of their store and maintain or change branding without constraints (for instance, making custom themes)

* Freedom to sell and buy practically everything – while it is possible to sell/buy everything online, most „white-net marketplaces“ have some basic restrictions against illicit goods in the form of negative ratings, reporting abuse, etc. With that said, anything can be sold/bought.

* Privacy & security – reduced risks of leaking customers data, no central servers to attack

## But……what are we trading? 

A general theme that appears relevant to this whole discussion is “what is being traded?”, namely is it: 

(1) tokens/assets that are natively on the blockchain

(2) or tokens representing assets that exist off-the-blockchain (cash, real estate, preferred stock in General Motors, Mortgage-Backed Securities, etc.?

Blockchain-based assets (cryptocurrencies or the shares of DAOs/DACs) can be natively settled on the blockchain, even across blockchains/side chains / etc., which means a decentralized settlement approach is doable. In addition, there are various ways that they could be represented on the blockchain (colored coins, platforms like Counterparty, NXT, Ethereum, and so on). However, to date, all of these lack a decentralized enforcement mechanism on the settlement side ‘off-blockchain.’
In other words, if you buy ten shares of IBM or an apartment in the United States or 1,000 euros, how do you enforce delivery in the ‘real world’? You can have contractual agreements that are legally binding, but that is not any more decentralized than the current model. Of these models, the least centralized would be that the security issuer makes this commitment (off-blockchain) that ‘Tokens 1 to 1,000,000’ represent ‘Security Class X’ of General Motors. It would still require the full armor of SEC supervision under US law as far as we know…
ICOs have arisen claiming to create smart contracts without coding (e.g., Etherparty) or produce legally enforceable contracts on the blockchain (e.g., SmartOne).
See: [Are Smart Contracts Real Contracts?](https://medium.com/@collindyer/are-smart-contracts-real-contracts-810527180868)


## Synthetic assets

One possible area for exploration is recreating off-blockchain assets ‘synthetically’ on the blockchain. There is precedent for this in the financial world with derivatives that emulate the cash flows (or a subset of the cashflows) of a certain instrument but are not the instrument itself (and do not require the consent or participation of the issuer). This would require, at a minimum, a working model for ‘oracles’ into the blockchain so that information from the outside world like ‘stock prices’ or ‘inflation’ or ‘inches of rain today’ or ‘did IBM default on this security can be passed into the blockchain for processing

A creator of the instrument (issuer)
Pre-funding of the instrument and the ability to pull in more funding to meet margin requirements as values change.
AKA if you are selling a credit default swap on IBM, on Day 1, a logical pre-funding would be a tiny % of the value of the bonds of IBM given their high creditworthiness. Over time, however, if their ratings drop, the issuer would need to provide more capital, or the position should be automatically closed.


## Conclusions
To date, cryptocurrency exchanges are more centralized than their ‘traditional’ counterpart exchanges.
Decentralized exchanges have appeared.

Clearing and settlement issues will be different for on-blockchain assets and off-blockchain assets.

On-blockchain assets will clear and settle natively, and without counterparty risk/centralization Off-blockchain assets will still require some linkage to the offline world (e.g., a custodian)

Synthetic blockchain securities might potentially resolve on/ off-blockchain issues but likely require a model for oracles being in place.
