# BC-3.3.6.6 The legal status of a DAO	

A DAO is not easy to define currently, as we‘ve learned in the regulation course:
•	general partnership, in which members own the assets of their business but are personally liable and
any member that could represent a DAO could be sued
•	an unincorporated association, where some members have limited liability but generally don‘t create a legal entity, any member that the state first observes the contact with can be sued
•	joint venture.

There is a problem defining it as a partnership. Participants have only one specific thing. They sent some tokens to the smart contract. Also, there are usually no restrictions on who can join, either. By the nearest person theory, the creator of a DAO would be held responsible for any damages resulting from the operation of DAO. However, what happens when DAO has multiple and even unknown creators? Maybe the members of DAO could be jointly held liable, as they are funding a DAO and possibly expect direct or indirect profits. If that would be the case, how can users be responsible for others‘ actions or bugs in the code?

In rem jurisdiction (rights over the property), legal actions are taken against the property, even unknown persons. The state will not allow illegal activities, no matter what. Therefore, despite not knowing who the members in a DAO are, it can forbid it nonetheless.

## Update
At the moment, it is possible, in different parts of the world, to legally launch a DAO (Wyoming, Estonia, etc.). However, it remains a grey area. For example, the Koios DAO is launched under Dutch law from a Foundation, because otherwise its participants could be held accountable on individual basis.
