# BC-3.2.2 Tokenomics & Cryptoeconomics

## About this chapter? 
The previous paragraph described the concepts of game theory and trust between actors. This paragraph is all about bringing game theory systems to the next level and into the realm of cryptography and economics (economics = specialization of game theory concepts). Suppose economics/game theory and cryptography are combined and applied cleverly, like in Bitcoinâ€™s protocol. In that case, cryptoeconomics can lead to excellent new infrastructures that power individuals and the entire ecosystem. Welcome to the beautiful field of cryptoeconomics! 

## What will we discuss? 

BC-3.2.2.1 Tokenomics & Cryptoeconomics: a new field?

BC-3.2.2.2 Tokenomics & Cryptoeconomics: a systemic approach

## By the end of this lesson, I can:
1.	Explain what the difference is between token economics and cryptoeconomics (understand)
2.	Predict how cryptoeconomics could influence the different system levels (apply)
3.	Explain the multi-disciplinarity of cryptoeconomics (understand)
4.	Explain why it is essential to involve other disciplines in cryptoeconomics (understand)
