# BC-3.2 WEEK 2 CRYPTOECONOMICS 

As you have learned: blockchains radically transform our forms of governance and are “trustless” ledgers. As you might have realized now: they are, of course, not fully trustless but designed in such a way that spoofing the system will cost you dearly and following protocol is to your benefit. But what exactly is the use of a system where you can rely on the system instead of the users? That will be clear after the first chapter, 3.2.1, where we show you how concepts of game theory & trusting agents work and how you can benefit as different individuals from a system that has these elements incorporated in its design. We will show you that an optimal equilibrium, a world where everybody wins, may never happen. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t steer towards a system where cheating the system is discouraged. This can be done via designing token mechanisms. These game theory mechanics are enabled via cryptocurrencies/tokens/altcoins and are known as the field of “tokenomics” and “token design”. Chapter 3.2.2 will explain what tokenomics is, where we will take a closer look at tokens and their functions. Later on, we will unravel some basic token design principles in 3.2.4.

>💡 The main goal of tokens and token design should be: how do we benefit the entire network by incentivizing individuals. But remember while reading:
