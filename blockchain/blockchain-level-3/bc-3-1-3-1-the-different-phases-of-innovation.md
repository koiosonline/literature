# BC-3.1.3.1 The different phases of innovation

Let's think about innovation as the process of turning ideas into commercial practice and capturing value from them. We can identify four distinct phases, each with its own set of challenges, to be managed if innovation is to be successful:

1. Search (environment)
2. Select (strategy)
3. Implement (process) 
4. Value-capture (culture) 

## Example Model 1

## Apply yourself!
For each phase, there are different models. For example, if you take the third phase, the implementation phase, you can use models like below. It goes beyond the scope for now, but scan these models and realize that innovation can be cut out in steps. This goes for companies, but also on a personal level. 


<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac">‚ùìIs your personal environment optimized for innovation and improvement? What steps could you take to improve this / bring your environment to the next level? Why (not) take these steps? </blockquote>

 

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac">‚ùì What is your personal strategy to optimize opportunities for the next five years? What steps could you take to improve this / bring your strategy to the next level?  Why (not) take these steps?  XXX </blockquote>

 

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac">‚ùì Are your personal processes structured in such a way that they are optimized for innovation and improvement? What steps could you take to improve this / bring your process to the next level?  Why (not) take these steps? </blockquote>

 

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac">‚ùì What value do you want to capture how, and why? Are you optimized for value capture? What steps could you take to improve this / bring your process to the next level?  Why (not) take these steps? </blockquote>

>üí° Realize that these phases are not done in a linear line due to many complications and many involved factors in this process. You have to circle back and forth many times over! 

We will now do a deep dive per stage. Enjoy the swim üòä
