#BC-3.2.3 All about tokens

## About this chapter?
To enable these crypto-economic systems, we need to incentivize the actors. This paragraph is all about the What: with “what,” can we incentivize the actors? That’s right: tokens! Part of the incentivization is the ability to transfer value between peers in all its different digital forms. Hence, the use-case of tokens enables this value transfer on a peer to peer basis in a cryptographically secured manner & designed via economic / game theory principles. Are the cryptocurrency enthusiasts correct? Will we really “tokenize the world”? Let’s take a closer look ☺!!!
