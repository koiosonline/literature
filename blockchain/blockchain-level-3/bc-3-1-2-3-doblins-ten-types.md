# BC-3.1.2.3 Doblinâ€™s ten types

[Doblinâ€™s Ten Types of Innovation]( https://www.doblin.com/ten-types) is a model that can be used to revisit existing strategies to develop viable innovations across all levels of your organization. 
This framework can be used as a diagnostic tool to assess how innovation should be approached internally and evaluate which aspects to improve on that arenâ€™t solely focused on technology innovation. This kind of holistic approach can help you analyze your competitive environment, reveal gaps and potential opportunities for incremental improvement, and do something unique. 

The Ten Types of Innovations model claims that all significant innovations throughout history are comprised of some combination of the following categories of innovations:

In the Ten Types of Innovation framework, the different types of innovations are divided into three main categories: 

1. configuration

2. offering 

3. experience. 

In laymanâ€™s terms, business model, product, and marketing.

The types on the left side of the framework are the most internally focused and distant from customers. However, as you move toward the right side, the types become increasingly apparent and obvious to end-users. 

Although it may not be realistic to start working on all these areas at once, especially if you are new to innovation. Still, you can use this framework to analyze your current state and the existing competition to spot areas that need immediate attention, are missing altogether, or could become competitive advantages for your innovation. 

## 6 tips for using the framework effectively


1. **Understand all ten types**. Virtually all projects can improve just by knowing and deeply understanding the value and subtleties of each of the types

2. **De-emphasize reliance on products and technology**. These are the most effortless capabilities for competitors to copy. 

3. **Think about categories as well as types**. Then, consciously imagine new ways to configure assets, build platforms, and foster fresh experiences.

4. **Use the types that matter most**.  Then, use diagnostics to understand which types you and others in your industry tend to overlook.
5. **Understand what your users need.** User research can help you know what is relevant to customers and what surprises other types might help to deliver.

6. **Use enough of the types to make a splash**. Using five or more types, integrated with care, is nearly enough to reinvent a category and become newsworthy.

Once you get more experienced with innovation, youâ€™d ideally want to focus on making continuous improvements in all, or at least most, of these areas.

## So whatâ€™s next? 

Understanding the categories and types of innovation is just the first step towards understanding and capitalizing on the endless opportunities with innovation. The most ambitious innovators find the right mix of different innovations and apply them as extensively as possible within their organizations. Instead of relying on a single R&D process, or a single type of innovation, they use and manage different innovations holistically and systematically.
