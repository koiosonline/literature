# BC-3.1.5.2 The innovative mindset 


## 7 tips from Steve Jobs 

When talking about the right innovation mindsets, we can't ignore Steve Jobs. Carmine Gallo, an author of "The Innovation Secrets of Steve Jobs", identifies seven fundamental principles that may help explain the success of Steve Jobs:

**1. Do what you love** – Passion, a mindset that only comes with doing what truly feels fascinating, is the precursor of creation and innovation.

Innovation is not a spontaneous burst of creation – it is a process, a path.
The mindset is needed to initiate a creative process, and inspiration does not arrive fortuitously.
Having passion and being involved in a process that allows passion for developing allows for that mindset to be formed.
Trust your intuition and pursue those things that fascinate you.
"If today were the last day of your life, would you want to do what you are about to do today?"

**2. Put a dent in the universe** – Use vision to set a goal.

Jobs' preliminary offering memorandum, seeking venture capital funding (in 1977!), outlines his vision of a new machine for the future, a personal computer. His vision was radical for the time. The computer would "save time and money; allow better financial decisions; provide security of personal information; reduce wasted energy and storage space; reduce pollution". 
By having a clear vision of your goals, you will be able to better direct efforts and minimize losses. Precise and robust goals also help transmit a better message to others.
Being able to articulate an achievable and rational objective organizes thinking and aims processes toward a future state.


**3. Inspire Evangelists**  – Innovation is not a one-person job. Behind every famous innovator is a team of competent individuals. Being able to organize their collective capacity into that set of goals is part of the job of a leader. So get people on your team, and off it, to become evangelists of your goals. One of Apple's strongest evangelists are its customers. In 1984, Steve Jobs painted that Apple was the only company that could prevent IBM domination. He invites people to join Apple and make history by changing the world and helping Apple succeed against IBM. Jobs sell a dream. Jobs evangelizes to people, infecting them with a worthy cause. The Macintosh way is not to sell. It is to evangelize. To evangelize requires a vision. Apple employees are small teams of passionate people building/pursuing their dreams.

**Innovation happens when people fall in love with a vision and work to make it a reality.
Have a bold, concise and consistent vision that can be internalized by the people around you.**

**4. Kick start your brain** – Find inspiration in everything: "Creativity is connecting things" – Steve Jobs

** 5. It is not essential to be a subject matter expert.** – Some of the world's most successful business leaders were not experts. Instead, they surrounded themselves with people who complemented them and helped provide a diversified approach.

* "Part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians, and poets, and artists, and zoologists, and historians who also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world." * 

To generate new ideas, **seek out new perspectives** and draw on a vast number of experiences and make new associations from them. **Take ideas from distant and unrelated areas of experience, integrate and apply them in different and novel ways.** Immerse yourself in situations that are outside your comfort zone.

**6. Sell dreams, not products** – Jobs believed that the people who bought his products were not consumers, rather people with hopes, dreams, and ambitions.

* "Lastly, I want to talk a little about Apple, the brand, and what it means to a lot of us. I think you still have to think differently to buy an Apple computer. I think the people who do buy them do think differently. They are the creative spirits in this world. They are people who are not out to get a job done; they are out to change the world. And they are out to change the world using whatever great tools they can get. And we make tools for those kinds of people. Hopefully, what you see here today are some beginning steps that give you some confidence that we, too, will think differently and serve the people who have been buying our products since the beginning. Because a lot of times people think they're crazy, but in that craziness, we see genius, and those are the people we're making tools for."* - Apple's ad campaign, after Steve Jobs's return (1997)

**7. Say no to 1,000 things** – Innovation means eliminating the unnecessary.

* **Simplicity is key**:
* "The way we approach design is by trying to achieve the most with the very least. We are consumed by trying to develop a solution that is very simple because, as physical beings, we understand clarity."* – Jonathan Ive, Apple Design Guru

By 1998, Apple had cut its total product offerings from 350 to 10. Product simplification was key to resuscitating Apple. Jobs encouraged innovation, even non-systemic innovation, but was also open to saying no to things to maintain focus and keep the company on track

Apple's design philosophy: **Keep your design simple, elegant, and focused.** For example, MacBook 2008 with an aluminum unibody enclosure. This allowed for a stronger, simpler, and thinner product. **The thirty-second rule**: a user must be able to open the product and use it within 30 seconds without the aid of a manual. Sometimes complexity in a product is indicative of a design and innovation problem, not a design breakthrough. 

The same goes for **product presentation**: An essential component of every product is how it is offered to the consumer. One factor of Apple's success was the hype behind every product and the keynote addresses of Steve Jobs. **Deliver a simple presentation, strip it down of cluttered formalities and unnecessary delays.** During the iPad presentation, Jobs used the Rule of Three, which states that humans can only process three or four chunks of information in short-term memory. Thus, the information regarding the iPad was made in three key points.* "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."* 

**Create insanely great experiences** – Apple's business model has been strongly focused on creating experiences, not selling machines.

**The message is as important as the product itself.** 

A poor selling strategy may derail months of work. Jobs was an excellent storyteller who captivates audiences, regardless of whether they are consumers, clients, shareholders and members of the board of directors, even employees. **The ability to get everyone on board with your idea to your strategy is crucial in its implementation.** By bringing everybody on board, not only does the implementation of the strategy flows easily, but they also become evangelists. 

** Master the message **– Communicating passion and excitement for a product is one of the most important traits of a successful entrepreneur. Marketing an idea is almost as important as the idea itself. **The message is as important as the product itself.** 

## What distinguishes an innovator like Steve Jobs?

**Questioning**. Constantly challenge the status quo (for example, the iPad resulted from Steve's questioning why there was a gap between the iPhone and the Macbook).

**Experimenting**. Engaging in active experimentation by seeking new surroundings, intellectual exploration, or physical tinkering.

**Networking**. Surrounding oneself with people that expand the domain of knowledge.

**Observing**. Carefully watching others, including potential customers. This is a source for chief breakthroughs.

## A nine-minute pitch 
9 Slides that Williams considers essential to create and prepare a pitch that will help sell the idea and solution:
Slide 1: Point out the shortcomings of the Status-Quo Slide  

Slide 2: Why is this an issue (include your observations) 

Slide 3: How is this a problem for consumers. Up to this point, you have built up tension. 

Slide 4: Tell them something they were not aware of, insight on the market, industry, or product. 

Slide 5: Show ways in which the insight can be applied or used

Slide 6: Give an analogy, an example that illustrates the point. Make them believe in you and the idea, now unveil the solution. 

Slide 7: Reveal the answer to the question, give them the solution 


Slide 8: Tell them why consumers will go for this solution

Slide 9: Evangelize what the solution's higher purpose is, the Ethos.
