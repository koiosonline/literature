# BC-3.1.8.4 Inter-operability between blockchains

In the existing internet, we can access and modify numerous data sets through APIs (application specific interfaces). However with blockchains, data is siloed by the chain that it exists on. 

So what does it mean to have interoperability between blockchains?

1.	Trustlessly transfer assets between different chains

2.	Cross-chain smart contracts that can interact with each other

3.	Specialised chains that can be used by other blockchains


## Examples 

Examples of such projects are Cosmos and Polkadot. Read more about them [here]( https://tokeneconomy.co/the-state-of-crypto-interoperability-explained-in-pictures-654cfe4cc167)
