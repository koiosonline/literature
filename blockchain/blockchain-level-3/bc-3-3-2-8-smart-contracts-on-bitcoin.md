# BC-3.3.2.8 Smart contracts on Bitcoin

Smart contracts on the Bitcoin network are mainly based on 3 techniques: 
1. multi signature 
2. check log time / sequence time 
3. (new) hash log time (encryption of IOU)

## Example projects 

Combination lead to projects like:
 
* [Rootstock]( https://www.rsk.co/)

* [Counterparty ]( https://counterparty.io/)

* [Antonopoulos on smart contracts on bitcoin]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRI_n6MyUW0)


## Innovation is limited by design
As discussed, due to the limitations in Bitcoins design, the use cases for smart contracts, as compared to other protocols, is limited. The innovation on platforms like Ethereum seem to develop faster for the last few years (DeFi, NFT's, Web3 applications). Slowly, but steadily, you see the usecases of each blockchain arise (Bitcoin's usecase would be sound money/digital gold)
