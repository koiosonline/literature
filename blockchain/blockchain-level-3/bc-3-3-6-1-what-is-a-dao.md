# BC-3.3.6 Decentralised Autonomous Organisations 


About this chapter? 

With the basic understanding of previous paragraphs, it is now time to put them all together. Possibly one of the most interesting governance developments in current society: the decentralised autonomous organisations a.k.a. the DAO. 

## What will we discuss? 

BC-3.3.6.1 What is a DAO

BC-3.3.6.2 The possibilities of a DAO 

BC-3.3.6.3 Governing the new form of governance 

BC-3.3.6.4 The first DAO “DAO”

BC-3.3.6.5 Potential use-cases DAO’s 

BC-3.3.6.6 The legal status of a DAO	

## After this class, I can:

* Explain what a DAO is and what the role of blockchain and smart contracting is in a DAO (understand)

* Predict the roles of DAO’s in future societies (apply)

* Formulate a possible role for a DAO in the KOIOS ecosystem, focussed on increasing student participation (create)

A [decentralized autonomous organization]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) (DAO), sometimes labelled a decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC), is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by shareholders and not influenced by a central government. A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain
The precise legal status of this type of business organization is unclear. 

A well-known example, intended for venture capital funding, was The DAO, which launched with $150 million in crowdfunding in June 2016, and was immediately hacked and drained of US$50 million in cryptocurrency. This hack was reversed in the following weeks, and the money restored, via a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain. This bailout was made possible by the Ethereum miners and clients switching to the new fork.




DAOs tackle an age-old problem of governance, which political scientists and economists refer to as the principal-agent dilemma. This occurs when the agent of an organization has the power to make decisions on behalf of, or impacting, the principal – another person or entity in the organization. Examples hereof could be managers that act on behalf of shareholders or politicians that act on behalf of citizens. In such setups, moral hazard occurs when one person takes more risks than they normally would, because others bear the cost of those risks. More generally, it occurs when the agent acts in his own interest rather than the interest of the principal because the principal cannot fully control the agent‘s actions. This dilemma usually increases when there is underlying information asymmetry at play.
