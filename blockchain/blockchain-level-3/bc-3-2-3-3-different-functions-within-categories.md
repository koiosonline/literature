# BC-3.2.3.3 Different functions within categories


See the image below to give you an (outdated) overview of the different types of tokens out there. Nowadays, there are even more categories and narratives, for example, DeFi & NFT project. The rankings and categories can be found via coin tracker websites like Coingecko.

>ðŸ’¡ The roles are determined based on the use-case of the token is often caused by its design, but if we shift based upon the design, we would have a different subcategory instead of role (see a few slides later). 

## Examples of different roles
**Currencies** â€“ Coins used primarily for payments and to store value.


**Protocols, Exchanges, and Interoperability **â€“ Projects building decentralized infrastructure to exchange cryptocurrencies and enable communication between blockchains.


**Computing, Data Management & Cloud Services **â€“ Projects related to computing, data storage, security, and cloud services, including file storage and cloud computing.


**Others **â€“ Projects that didnâ€™t fit into any of the other categories. These include prediction markets, oracles, betting platforms, and AI-related projects.


**Platforms **â€“ Smart contract and decentralized application (dapp) platforms.


**Gaming, Media, and Social Networking Platforms **â€“ Projects related to gaming, online content publishing and distribution, and social media.


**Privacy Coins**â€“ Currencies with features to make transactions anonymous and untraceable.


**FinTech **â€“ Financial services and technology.


**Business/Enterprise **â€“ Platforms meant to help businesses improve efficiency, transparency, and security, among other things.


>ðŸ’¡ One use case doesnâ€™t necessarily exclude the other. A token can have multiple use-cases. 

## Functions 


>ðŸ’¡ You can divide the functions of tokens in many other ways as well. For example, divide them by the role they play. 


Most common roles we encounter: 
 
**Incentivizing miners / PoW (BTC) **
The token is used to reward miners for securing the network and verifying transactions. The tokens are distributed to those nodes and the fastest miners, making it competitive (use-case). More and more people enter the network through this competition because they also want a piece of the pie. This makes the network more secure and allows for faster and cheaper transactions (benefit network). 


**Staking / PoS (Dash) **
In the PoS and Delegated PoS model, token holders can stake their holdings. Staking is the process of keeping your cryptocurrencies in a private wallet related to the cryptocurrencyâ€™s blockchain. This helps secure the network and stabilize the price of a cryptocurrency as fewer token holders trade these tokens (benefit network). In return, token holders usually receive rewards. PoS is a mechanism in which staking individuals have the chance to validate transactions based on the number of their token holdings (use-case). For instance, the PoS model is currently employed by Dash and OmiseGo. In the Delegated PoS model, which Lisk and Ark use, token holders can vote on delegates that validate transactions for which voters are awarded part of the earnings of the delegates. 


**Payment of transaction fees (XRP) **
Cryptocurrency users that conduct transactions pay a transaction fee (= use-case). This fee can go to the miners of a blockchain but also the entire network. For example, when you send Rippleâ€™s XRP to another wallet, a minor percentage of this transaction is burned as a means of payment. This payment is indirectly awarded to the entire network since the supply of XRP is decreased (= benefit network).



**Governance (DigixDAO) **
This involves sociology, psychology, networked cooperation, power distribution, and (new) models of democracy. Through token-based governance, network members that hold tokens can vote on the direction of the platform (= use-case). Developers can propose alterations to the networkâ€™s programming, upgrades, new features, and cooperations on which token holders can vote with their token holdings. In this way, token holders are part of the networkâ€™s governance process. The best example of this is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This is a fully]-automated, decentralized network that can perform tasks and provide products and services. DigixDAO is such a network that lets its token holders decide on protocol decisions. The number of holdings determines the weight of someoneâ€™s vote. DigixDAO has recently launched its stable coin DigixGold, which is pegged to the value of gold. DigixDAO token holders all share the profits of transaction fees of DigixGold. This incentivizes token holders to make informed decisions about the future undertakings of DigixDAO (= benefit network).


**Network contribution (Lunyr) **
Network participants can also be awarded for contributions to the network without this being automated. Lunyr, for example, is a knowledge-sharing platform on which users can submit articles. These articles are peer-reviewed by other users. Both writer and curator receive tokens as a reward for their contributions (= use case). On the other hand, if a contribution violates the platformâ€™s rules or a curator approves something that other curators do not accept, they can get penalized. It is important to note here that developers are much more inclined to aid in developing a platform when they own tokens of that platform since there is a personal financial stake involved (= benefit network). When the value of the platform increases, so does the value of the holdings of the developer. To increase this effect, the network can distribute tokens to key contributors to increase the personal financial stake, incentivizing them to develop the platform even more. 


**Blockchain-based services (Siacoin) **
Users need a blockchain applicationâ€™s native token to access the applicationâ€™s product or service (= use-case). For example, Siacoin is a decentralized cloud storage platform. Network members with excess digital storage capacity can rent this out to network members who need extra storage. Those that want extra storage pay the providers of storage with Siacoins for this service. Many more applications use this model, for example, Ethereum-based applications such as Augur, Civic, and Golem. As more people start using these blockchain-based products and services, the demand for the native currency will increase, making it more valuable (= benefit network).

**Profit-sharing (Binance) **
Some blockchain applications let their token holders share in the profits made by the platform (= use-case). Attracting more users that use the platform, creating more value for the network (benefit network)

## Many more 
Of course [many more roles are out there]( https://medium.com/paratii/on-the-immaturity-of-tokenized-value-capture-mechanisms-1fde33f2bc8e), some of them havenâ€™t even been thought of.
