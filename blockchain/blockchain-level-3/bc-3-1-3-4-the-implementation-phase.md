# BC-3.1.3.4 The implementation phase

## Phase 3: Implementation (how are we going to make it happen?) 

After searching (generating innovation ideas) and selecting (choosing among alternatives), an organization is faced with the challenge of implementing the chosen ideas into marketable products or services. Implementation usually takes organizing and managing innovation projects (the process is known as new product development – NPD). It is all about converting ideas into reality. Challenge: manage an extensive array of resources (time, energy, capital, knowledge) against a background of uncertainty. Focus on PROCESS. 


Most organizations are not good at developing new products (or services or ventures). They have been designed and structured for a different purpose: serving day-to-day operational needs. In contrast, new product development is an infrequent and unusual requirement. The project management structure is strongly correlated with product success.

*The KOIOS example: activities are structured in the AirTable tool*

So, the first decision is: what kind of team to put together to develop new product?
Functional teams: people from a single department/division, typically research, marketing, or design
(✔ coherent groups; ✖ beware of organizational myopia)
Project teams: cross-functional groups dedicated to NPD
(✔ more effective at bringing ideas to fruition; ✖ loss of touch with everyday business)
Matrix teams: teams of people from different functions who also retain their regular jobs
(✔ very effective; ✖ challenging to manage; beware of organizational politics and day-job priorities)

Product development typically works in *design – test – build* cycles. Addresses, in an iterative cycle, gaps between current product design and changing market requirements. It determines the speed and effectiveness of the problem-solving process. The participation of actual users/customers is essential at this stage.
