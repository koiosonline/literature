# BC-3.1.8 Off-chain scaling & improvements

## About this chapter?
Remember: all of the offered solutions have their trade-offs. For example, the blockchain scaling trilemma also applies to off-chain scaling solutions. 

## What will we discuss? 

BC-3.1.8.1 What are sidechains? 

BC-3.1.8.2 One way pegging & Blockchain Anchoring 

BC-3.1.8.3 Two-way pegging & atomic swaps

BC-3.1.8.4 Inter-operability between blockchains

BC-3.1.8.5 On-chain scaling or off-chain scaling? 

## After this lesson, I can: 

1.	Describe what a sidechain is and why this is important for blockchains (understand)

2.	Describe the one way and two-way pegging sidechains and their examples anchoring respectively atomic Swaps (understand)

3.	Illustrate to what inter-operability between blockchains could lead to (evaluate)

4.	Evaluate the different on- and off-chain methods for scaling blockchains and chose a preferred method for my preferred narrative (evaluate)
