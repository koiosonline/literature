# BC-1.5.4 The history of money 

>ðŸ’¡  Although money plays a vital role within our society, it is strange that we don't know how it exactly works. Nor what the exact history is of money (debated). 


## Money is a weird place right now

We don't know what the first type of money was. We even don't know whether there was a barter economy on a scale. So I'm not going to give you an entire "go through" to the whole history. Instead, if you would like that, please see the further readings. The bottom line is that the improvement of our money comes way faster in the last few decades than the thousands of years before us. Then, of course, there were always minor tweaks and sometimes significant changes like the gold switch! It took people centuries to switch from gold to paper. But currently, we are very efficiently scaling and switching between money, with bitcoin as the most recent example. 

Other recent examples of changes in money: the introduction of credit cards 60 years ago, letting go of the gold standard on a global scale (full fiat 1971). And we had foreign money exchanges (ForEx) popping up, with at least 5.1 trillion $ volume exchanging each day in foreign currencies. And now we even have decentralized money entering the scene, with a new ruleset: an algorithm determining consensus rules. 


>ðŸ’¡  So, money can be defined by law, by communities, by custom, by the utility. Money is in a weird place at the moment. Its core elements and reasons for existence per type of money are heavily discussed since the crisis of 2007 and the rise of cryptocurrencies. 

I am living proof of that: before 2008, before the crisis, and before the invention of Bitcoin, I had never given any thought about our money. It was just there, and I was using it. And even the change from the Guilder to the euro passed. Like it was just a random thing that happens every day. I didn't give it any second thought. Probably my age had something to do with it as well. Still, by my estimation most people nowadays don't think about money (how it works / what it is. This doesn't apply to how to acquire it ;-) 

## Money is a story
We work for money, so why don't we give it a second thought? Everybody blindly follows the "story", which again shows the immense power a well-told story can have. Fun fact: imagination is what separates us in the animal kingdom. Imagination (and movable thumbs ðŸ˜‰?) allowed us to rise above other species, but believing in fictional stories is still strange and illogical behavior. Or not? Because it will enable us to scale mass corporations. 

>ðŸ’¡  With blockchain technology, trust in a story moves from unverifiable human behavior to verifiable computations. 

## The history of money 

History is hard to pinpoint exactly. Somehow, the definite origins of money have been lost to history. A [general overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_money):

* 7000 BC (?) - 2000 BC - Mesopotamia; Ancient Sumaria. Prehistoric: money accounting to a standard value w/out transferable tokens
* 2000 BC â€“ 700 BC Standardized coinage (precious metal) 
* 700 BC â€“ 400 AD â€“ Roman banking system (single entry) Asia Minor; Greek Empire; Roman Empire
* 400 AD â€“ 1400 AD - Metal coinage
* 1400 AD â€“ 1940Â´s â€“ Metal coinage & (backed) credit-money 
* 1940's â€“ 2008 â€“ Increasingly more credit and unbacked trusted third party money
* 2008 decentralized peer-to-peer, sound, private (ownership) self-sovereign money 


## No barter economy, an alternative story 

Recap of an alternative story for barter economy by Heinson and Steiger (1983)

1. Used to be self-sufficient communities, where people took care of each other. 
2. Private property was introduced ("essential uncertainty"), you became responsible for your own social and economic well-being. 
3. Built up security by excess production (stock)
4. People started borrowing, and increased borrowing led to "regulation" (abolishing, for example, 600 BC in Athens). The risk increased, interest introduced itself. Type of loans expanded, need of standardized unit of account (wheat/grain!). Temples played a role in standardizing ("trusted wise alderman"). Wheat money from the account served as repayment. 
5. To reduce transaction costs (like counterfeit), temples switched to stamped metal 

Linguistic and historical proof: 

* Greek Drachma: "a fistful" (of grain), Babylonian/Judean Shekel, Livre (Lira, Pound [lb.]) and current UK Pound of course. 
* The Code of Hammurabi (ca. 2123â€“2108 B.C.) specified grain money for certain payments

## Conclusion

>ðŸ’¡  Money is not a thing, but the properties items can have when they function as a unit of account, a store of value, and a medium of exchange. It can be defined in law (i.e., legal tender like FIAT), in practice (a bearer bond), or custom (cigarettes in a prison camp, Radford, 1945). 


>ðŸ’¡  And the moneyness of the thing can derive from scarcity (cowry shells, gold), trust (commodity money, Fiat money), and utility (payments networks such as credit cards). 


>ðŸ’¡  The form of money maps the evolution of economies. Money evolves as new technologies and protocols better solve money-ness properties. Money, in other words, is a dynamic ledger, and like all technologies evolves and develops through time. 


>ðŸ’¡  Attempts to build better money have for the past half-century or so been focused on platforms for digital money. First private payments platforms (credit cards) and derivative markets. The second generation, starting in the 1990s, sought to build new types of money with new protocols on digital infrastructure (Cohen 2001). Early attempts, with varying degrees of market success, were DigiCash (David Chuam), Bitgold (Nick Szabo), b-money (Wei Dai), PayPal (Peter Thiel)


>ðŸ’¡  Third generation electronic money: Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency. Using blockchain technology to recombine aspects of earlier ideas. One that finally technically succeeded, solving the double-spending problem that had previously locked digital money into a centralized network. 


>ðŸ’¡  The discovery in 2008 of a new technology of money using distributed ledgers secured with consensus protocols has given monetary economists a new view on the evolution of money.
