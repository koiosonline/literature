# BC-1.5.3 The functions of money


## Money is a "human institution".

So what does this mean?

>üí° An institution is a mental framework created by humans. Animals don't see them as we do. They are part of our imagination and storytelling.

Money is "money" because we humans deem it as "money". So a human institution means that if somebody not human looks at it, it will look at it differently (through the eyes of an animal, e.g.). So other animals will see a hump of metal, where you see the money. Just remember human institutions as "stories" we humans tell each other and in which we believe. Money is the most powerful story of them all. Almost everybody believes in the concept of money. But remember: it is just a story.


As discussed, our stories and beliefs (institutions) change. Other examples are concepts like religion, time, etc. They can vary depending on the culture, region, time. So does the story change what we tell about money. Throughout history, we have primarily used the money to exchange value. So we invented money to facilitate trade and exchange. A common misconception in this storyline is that there used to be a "barter" economy in the past. Where you could exchange ten chickens for one cow, that wouldn't always work because you don't always need ten chickens. And what would a school teacher use to exchange? This problem is also known as the (double) coincidence of wants.

## No barter economy

More importantly: there was never a global barter economy. At least not on a worldwide scale. What you do see is that when a currency fails, a barter economy sometimes arises. We have seen this several times in Argentina and in Greece recently. So some form of barter economy has always been there. But not on such a massive scale as we are currently taught to believe. We will give you the deep dive in the "all about money" course. For now it is not so relevant.



## The three functions of money

What is relevant, though, is that we use the money for three things:

1. **Medium of exchange:** We want to use the money to facilitate exchange.
See it as a sort of grease to keep the machine turning, as an oil to keep ongoing. In other words: I, as a lecturer, now receive repayment for my time that I can use to buy a chicken. So I don't need a cow anymore. I can use something else that everybody can use to exchange.

2. We also use the money to **store our value**. As a stock. In other words: I can save it up (for later).

3. Money is also used to compare or measure things (**unit of account**). So how much is this cup worth compared to the eraser? If you don't use money, how will you determine the price of each of these things? Is it 3,5, or 4 erasers for 1 cup? So money denominated in a currency provides insight, and I now know how to exchange these goods. **This hassle you have when you don't have money is also known as computational costs**. But now I don't have to think about the exchange prices anymore. I can see in an instant what the prices are. For example, the cup is 10 euro, and the eraser is 1 euro, so I need to exchange ten erasers for 1 cup.



>üí° It is essential to realize that the transaction costs are less by the introduction of money. So money makes transactions more efficient (= increased tx cost-efficiency!).

We don't need to hire somebody to calculate the exchange rate (money acts as an intermediary). We don't need anybody to bring physical gold from country A to country B. We now have paper notes, which are easier to carry and even better: we can transfer them in the digital realm. So you won't be stabbed on the road ;-) So the better form of money, the better the transaction (tx) cost efficiency! Better forms of money will therefore lead to better conditions of economies (more efficient forms). Because you have fewer costs, less "friction". In other words: it is faster, cheaper, lighter, etc. All the properties we have seen and discussed before will score higher grades when a new type of money is introduced and grows to its full potential.

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac"> >‚ùì Is bitcoin this new form of money? </blockquote> 

We will discuss this in length in upcoming sessions. But now you know more about:
- the properties of money
- the functions why we use money
- and the main goal --> reduce transaction costs. In other words: increasing tx efficiency.

We are reducing time, reducing costs, creating less friction, and enabling new forms of economies & societies. I will see you all in the next session! First, we briefly discuss the history of money (origin story). From there, we will introduce bitcoin, the world's first decentralized money application :-)!

## Conclusion

1. Medium of exchange = facilitates trade & commerce

* Reduces transaction costs/increase transaction cost-efficiency
* Must be socially acceptable and recognized widely
* The ease/efficiency to be exchanged for products & services. Current currencies represent a more efficient way to exchange products and services than the barter system. Intermediary between products or services that people want to trade.


2. Unit of account = measure & compare value
* Price things in these units ( $, EUR )
* Standard unit of pricing everything (think about the introduction of the Euro)
* A standard measurement to compare the value of goods, services, economic activities, assets, and liabilities.

3. Store of value (wealth) = extremely liquid, but subject to inflation risk
* A repository of purchasing power over time.
* Highly liquid ‚Äì i.e., convertible into cash or medium of exchange
* A store of value is a mechanism by which wealth can be saved and retrieved in the future. With some predictability about its future value. Store of value is not a function solely of currencies but of assets in general.
