# BC-1.1.6 Problems with centralized ledgers

Let's start this session with the benefits of centralized ledgers (over decentralized ledgers, for example). 

>💡 The advantage of a centralized ledger is that it is pretty efficient. Keep in mind, efficient within that particular closed-off environment. 

Although it harbors several risks, it functioned in the industrial age. As long as the responsible party keeps being trustworthy, the system works perfectly fine in the active regions at that time. But….humanity evolved to a next phase. A digital and global stage introduced itself. Due to growth and scaling, the pressure on these centralized ledgers increased. Sometimes painfully displaying the risks and limitations.

</blockquote>

> 💡 We can summarise the risks in three main categories. I would like you to pay attention here. We will often refer to these three main categories, which are essential in determining if something needs a centralized or decentralized approach. The three main categories of downsides (being a limitation or a risk) are:
1 Exclusion
2 Dishonesty
3 Loss of records 

## Exclusion

The exclusion would be that you, as a trusted third party, could say: "Hey! You are not allowed in my ledger!". An example would be the banking system denying somebody with an Iranian passport. Another example is the TTP being the owner/manager of the ledger and data. Often they protect this advantage from abuse or for competitive commercial reasons. For example, when you raise a wall around data, other people can't access all of it. The border gives the TTP a vast colossal advantage because data nowadays is worth a lot of value. "Data is the new gold". 

>💡 The first category, an exclusion means that you are not allowed to participate with the ledger. OR can't access the data or other benefits. So you are, to some degree, excluded by the TTP. And some people more than others.

## Dishonesty
>💡 The second category is dishonesty. Corruption or abuse of power is always the most straightforward example. For example, you ran the show as a bookkeeper. Somebody can give you a few extra dollars to administer them a few extra dollars more in their account. Worse, you could also start creating dollars out of thin air because nobody can see or understand your entire ledger. 

Because this risk of dishonesty exists, we hire other intermediaries. Other trusted parties to check up on the TTP. They are often done by an auditor/certified accountant. 

>💡 Realize that this audit is done by "soft" humans and not by "hard" mathematics (although they do sometimes use mathematics in their audit). More importantly, though, these checks often only focus on one entity, the TTP in this case, and not the entire system of TTP's connected as a whole. 

More about this later on, where we discuss the monetary system. For now, about dishonesty...just remember the corruption as an example.

## Loss of records
>💡 The third one is the loss of records (data)—examples: hit by a natural disaster or when records get hacked. The problem here is that they have a single entity to attack, also known in IT as the "single point of failure". In everyday language: the chain is as strong as its weakest link. 


Remember these three categories of downsides of centralized ledgers. They are inherent to the design, and every centralized ledger harbors these downsides: 

1. Exclusion
2. Dishonesty
3. Loss of records

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac"> ❓ As you will see later on, these downsides can take many different forms. Can you already think of one example per category? [Check answers🦉](https://twitter.com/JordiJansen101/status/1431292595217518594?s=20)</blockquote> 


The next session will be about the distributed decentralized ledgers. We first explain the benefits of those types compared with the centralized counterparts—afterward, the downsides and challenges. 


## Portfolio assignment 1.1.6 Problems with centralized ledgers
Select a centralized ledger from your own country and find examples of the three main categories of downsides. If you need inspiration, think of government agencies, commercial parties, public institutions like your University, etc. Build from your own experience and connect the content with your everyday life.
