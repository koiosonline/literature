# The fiat experiment (2/2)

You now know that if you control the ledger, you contain the power. Especially when that ledger is the money ledger ;-) 

We haven't discussed another benefit of controlling the ledger. Not only can you create money. You also own all the data and determine a lot of the rules. This makes for a bit of an uncomfortable situation. A single entity owns the data, vulnerable to attacks (or commercial gains). Money is a language, and your tongue is monitored, and often sold as well.

I recently received an email from my bank, where they stated that they would give me "personalized commercials". 5 years ago, people still responded "[outrageous](https://www.zdnet.com/article/privacy-outrage-causes-bank-to-ditch-plans-for-targeted-ads-based-on-customers-spending-habits/)", but in 2019 it was more accepted. I didn't ask for personalized commercials. I, however, don't have an opt-out of this system. This is because I can't choose an alternative (if we ignore cryptocurrencies). I do have one option, of course. I could still use cash as one of the alternatives out of this commercial banking system. 

But what if you can't pay with cash anymore. Cash is getting banned more and more. Recently the Netherlands wrote a proposal to don't allow for cash payments above 3K from 2020 on. The main reason often stated is that it is to prevent criminal money laundering. Still, we will, later on, explain that this doesn't make much sense. Nor very efficient. 

It only seems natural that we grow towards a physically cashless society. But the point to be made here is that digital cash should be digital cash and not digital debt-based commercial bank money. So a public digital variant of physical cash is in the making. Control moves from commercial banks to Central Banks via the new currencies in the making: Central Bank Digital Currencies. It seems like they will act as a centralized variant of cash, an alternative for decentralized bitcoins, commercial facebook coins, or commercial bank euros. All are different. All serve different use-cases.

As you might have guessed, I'm personally more attracted to decentralized money. Mainly because of the three main risks I foresee in centralized alternatives. And the increased efficiency of eliminating the intermediary and all the benefits this has for users. I expect the CDBC's to rise soon, most likely because you will be able to pay taxes with it (use case for fiat).  

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac"> ❓ Why do I keep on hammering on data ownership and its importance? </blockquote> 

Because you can be easily switched off by controlling powers if you do not abide by their rules, take China, for example. There, your transactions are monitored, and connected to your social media profiles as well. If you joined the demonstration in Hong Kong and paid for the subway, you got arrested. Or, if you buy alcohol or don't show 'good citizen behavior,' points are deducted. Points you need to travel. Or where you can't get a mortgage anymore because you crossed a red light more than three times. Absurd? But true ☹  It doesn't mean that because this is happening on the other side of the world, it can't happen here? "One wrong election away, and your monetary system might get a hold on you as well." 

Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p-6c692Zbw) from Andreas Antonopoulos. He can explain this way better than I can. However, keep in mind that reality is always more nuanced. So apply the complementary opposite approach and approach challenges from multiple different directions.

Note: if this chapter went too fast, no worries. We will cover a lot more about money and how it functions in chapter 1.5! 

We will see you in the next session, where we will discuss "software & eating the world!".

Research online how much the country's currency where you live has devalued over the past 20 years. Tip: Search for purchasing power + your currency. What is your opinion about this inflation?
