# BC-1.5.5.1 Fiat money 1/4 ‚Äì inflation

Before we start bashing on the current monetary system, do realize that the system has also had some benefits. But, more importantly, realize that most of those benefits are not available for a very large part of the earth's population. More than 90% don't have full access to an excellent working monetary system surrounding them, including loaning, insurance, etc. So they don't have the same access as a Western citizen (and remember: neither do all Western citizens have access!).


## Fiat money ‚Äì a recap

The money in our current monetary system is called fiat money. As you've already learned, fiat money is based on trust. And you also know that it consists of two different kinds of money. It is partially backed by debt-based money from commercial banks. And it is public money, better known as physical cash, backed by a central non-commercial/public bank. But both are denominated in the same currency name ("$" or "‚Ç¨"). This trust is enforced by law, imposed by rulers or other entities that hold power. The legislators allowed commercial banks to "print" money (not physically printed, but recorded in their ledgers). So our money isn't created by the government, despite common belief, but by other centralized entities. Mainly commercial banks and partly centralized banks.

>üí° The same three risks of centralized ledgers (dishonesty, loss of record, exclusion) apply to our current centralized monetary system. Often we witness dishonest behavior, like massive scale money laundering by entities with banking licenses. Or loss of records: think about the many hacks or the closed-off environments (the "operating behind the scenes"). But also the exclusion: at least 2 billion people don't have access to a bank account (several reasons, but outside scope of class). Keep in mind that these 2.7 billion people are only "the head of household", so for some reason, women, children, and elderly are not even taken into account of this count of the unbanked.


## A widening gap between "rich" and "poor"

The following examples or sources might show you the importance of the above, even for you. Not only is the monetary system itself unsustainable (an exponential increase of money). The unsustainable system is slowly officially being confirmed by even banks their-selves (see source further readings from German Bank). Because "money" is the institution, the story, that almost everybody believes impacts many other layers in society. One visible example is increasing stocks. Or rising house prices, unaffordable for many starters. Here in the Netherlands, the house prices in Amsterdam rose by >400% since 2002. Even my own house nearly doubled in value in 3 years. Because of inflation, it's a natural design of the system for prices to rise over time. But the issue here is that home values are [outpacing inflation]( https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/23/how-much-housing-prices-have-risen-since-1940.html). Thus, making it nearly impossible for new buyers to enter the market. This also creates an increasing difference in wealth between those holding assets and those who don't‚Äîa logical outcome when you keep pumping more money into an economy than you produce.

>üí°  All kinds of assets became more expensive, rising faster than regular salaries. This is creating an increasing wedge between people who own assets and people who don't, widening the gap between rich and poor. This gap will only increase. A good read on this topic is the book [Capital]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capital-Twenty-First-Century-Thomas-Piketty/dp/067443000X?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-brave-uk-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=067443000X) by Thomas Piketty.

## The challenges with centralized Fiat

So in these fiat sessions, we will discuss challenges that centralized money ledgers cause. We dive into this topic because the world's first public ledger (Bitcoin) aims to tackle these problems. And because money plays a vital role in the decentralized realm as well.

So before diving into the world of the new ledgers, you should understand a bit more of the current world. So that you can relate to and understand some of the proposed solutions, these blockchains aim to offer. In this course, we selected four different topics where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer alternatives. We tried to depict these topics as neutral as possible. Do remember that this course is created by people with a preference for decentralization and cryptocurrencies. So stay sharp and critical (and let us know any deficiencies in our story).

The four topics
1. Inflation
2. Bank runs
3. Errors
4. Cashless society


## #1 Inflation

So the first one up is [inflation]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beAvFHP4wDI) and [hyperinflation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-PNlhhVhZ8). Whether inflation is good or bad is all up to your point of view. Read about it in sources describing [benefits](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111414/how-can-inflation-be-good-economy.asp) and [downsides](https://www.moneycrashers.com/what-is-inflation-definition-causes-inflation-rate/) of inflation.

Just remember that one of the main reasons for inflation is that authorities managing inflation want consumers to keep purchasing to grow economies. So your money value drops each year, depending on your region with 1 to 5%, your money gets less and less valuable. Although this might not seem much on a one-year basis, imagine the impact on a larger time scale‚Äîthe effects on your pension or savings. Usually, you would get compensated for the inflation of your money with interest %. Still, with the current day's negative interest, your money devalues twice as fast. This is beneficial if you have debts, not so much if you save money. Some people, therefore, call inflation "just another form of tax".

There are assumptions behind inflation. We don't know if this is the (only) way to steer an economy. Nor do we know if the never-ending continuous growth of the economy is even possible. Or a desired/sustainable and healthy way for this planet? These assumptions remain outside the scope of this session.



So Fiat is not limited in supply and therefore not a very good store of value. It is not a good store of value because you lose your purchasing power. Store of value in short = will it keep or improve my purchasing power over time. So an alternative for storing/protecting your purchase power is buying assets like houses or other commodities that can't be "printed", like gold or bitcoin. An overview of money supply per country:

## Causes of inflation

What exactly causes inflation in an economy? There is not a single, agreed-upon answer, but there are a variety of theories, all of which play some role in inflation:
* The Money Supply
* The National Debt
* Demand-Pull Effect
* Cost-Push Effect
* Exchange Rates

If interested, read more about them in [this article]( https://www.moneycrashers.com/what-is-inflation-definition-causes-inflation-rate/).

## hyperinflation
When you talk about unlimited supplies of money, what could go wrong is the risk of "hyperinflation". In layman's terms: money is growing from trees. Ledger trees.
In the video, we show a note of 50.000 Indonesian Rupiah. This currency already experienced several hyperinflations. Large denotations are often a sign of instability.

![QE](http://images.oobject.com/thumbdir/thumbnails/3/05/305777230e62eabfe763877247d1de27-orig)

[Source](http://images.oobject.com/thumbdir/thumbnails/3/05/305777230e62eabfe763877247d1de27-orig)


But what is the problem with hyperinflation? Imagine you worked hard your entire life, and you eventually managed to save up to 100.000 Rupiah. Where 1 rupiah could buy you one bread (= purchase power). Suddenly, somebody thinks: "well, we produced too much money in our ledgers, let's denominate the currency by dividing it by 10. Or let's get rid of the small notes". This often happens. Recently in a massive country like India. All of a sudden, the 20 rupee notes were not "valid" anymore (2014). Which led to massive inflation and devaluation of their currency. All of a sudden, your life savings were worth way less than a week before.

In other words: you couldn't transfer your time from the past to the future. You couldn't hold down on your Store of Value (SoV). So how to save up "money" in those scenarios? Buying assets like houses isn't an available option for those that cannot afford it, so they are often struck hardest (once again, check the Piketty book).

You often see many different causes for hyperinflation. Overflowing an economy is usually a good start. We don't call this 'over extensive money production'. We called the increase of money supply [Quantitative Easing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TihoBfdCe8). We were solving short-term problems but creating long-term systematic risks of hyperinflation.

Below we added a picture of Germany after World War 2, where children play with piles of money. If the trust drops in the money, so does the value. To attack a currency, attack the belief that people have in that currency (attack the story!). It is one of the most efficient ways to get money down. It's especially efficient if it "runs on nothing", has nothing to back it, or has no other use cases.

## Conclusion
Our current monetary system isn't flawless. It has a very high percentage of unbanked (people without access to the system) and also runs on the philosophy of inflation. Inflation means that your money loses purchasing power so that you can buy less with your money each future period. Inflation is invented to motivate people to consume and grow the economy. It is often felt hardest by those who can't protect themselves against it. So an alternative for storing/protecting your purchase power is buying assets like houses or other commodities that can't be "printed", like gold or bitcoin.

We also discussed hyperinflation, where money is being circulated in too much abundance, and people lose their trust in the institution, resulting in tremendous loss of purchasing power of the money.
