# BC-1.5.2.3 What is Money 3/3

So you know the properties of money and the definition, but we will also discuss the "classifications" of money. I hope you do realize that this shell is not the same class of money as digital money. It has evolved. This is a key takeaway: Money evolves, so it better suits the society of that time. It is partly caused by new forms of ledgers that enabled us to record new types of money.


# The classes

* Commodity money ‚Äì money that has intrinsic value (gold, silver, livestock, salt, grains, gems)
* Representative money = paper notes/currency backed by a commodity / can be exchanged for a fixed amount of a valuable commodity. Usually gold or silver, but it can also be tobacco notes, for example. Example: the dollar before 1971.
* Fiat money = ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù money / ‚Äútrusted third party‚Äù money. It has no intrinsic value, nor can it be redeemed for commodities. Its value originates from government decree, or fiat Example: the dollar after 1971. Side note: mixed with commercial banks ‚Äúcredit money‚Äù.
* Credit money = Credit cards, checks, etc. Bank ‚Äúledger money‚Äù. Denominated in the same notes as Fiat money.
* Electric-money = debit cards, m-Pesa, etc.

## Some examples
Some fascinating examples can be found. For example, you can see how money evolved from huge Yap stones to digital bits & bytes in ledgers. And eventually to digital bits & bytes in decentralized ledgers. Realize, though: every time Money evolves, there is a significant impact on society. So this current "is bitcoin money, yes/no" discussion is new for our generation, but if you compare it with the
introduction of credit cards or the introduction of fiat money for when they left the gold standard in 1971. Or the introduction of paper notes instead of gold nuggets.


Every time the change of money impacts society, people tend to disagree. It all depends on how you cope with change. Very important is that we remain very critical of the type of money we use. It represents a fundamental pillar in our society. History has shown that money evolves with it as society evolves (and the other way around).

Essential to realizing we often tend to compare our current forms of money with primitive forms of money. We can't compare our current society with the societies from the past and therefore shouldn't compare money with the old days. The generations that used shells and [Yap stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones) are a good example: where you use a yap stone as money, you can't compare that type of money with our current forms of money. Its functions were different because these stones were mainly used for ceremonial things, status, etc. And not to buy a cup of coffee. We often tend to compare our current society with previous societies. In the case of money that is not doable, we will explain "the why" later, mainly because the comparison has led to a few common misconceptions.


## Money is a language
Money is also a tool for us to communicate. Although the original definition is money is used to pay for products and services, you can also see money as a form of communication. We share by moving money from person A to person B. We exchange values, and this way, we "talk" with each other. Of course, not in a linguistic way, but in another way. Therefore, money is a form of speech. Like we mentioned not "speech", but another way of expressing yourself. So for example by buying the clothing you like.

## Money is liquid time

>üí° money can also be seen as liquid time.

For example, suppose I work 8 hours now. In that case, I hope to save that time, so I save that time in money, where I receive back money for that 8 hours of my time and spend those same 8 hours later on something in the future in what I deem worthy of 8 hours of my time. So I could go to the cinema, buy myself some food or whatever you like or need to do with your money. Money, therefore, transfers time from period A to B.

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac"> ‚ùì Are ATMs, therefore, time machines üòâ? </blockquote> 

Keep this concept of money as liquid time in mind for later, introducing "liquid money". Liquid money is enabled because money is now digital and decentralized.

So (also) keep in mind that money is a form of speech/language and a form of "time-transferring". You can have different properties and definitions, and these are just two examples (language & time). I think you now have a decent idea of what money is. And that money can take several different forms. It is more than just notes. It is a story we share. This (showing note) is just an example of our current-day money. A keynote here is that money keeps evolving.

Don't get stuck in your current time period. Try to have an open mind and see where money came from and where it might go. So once more: Money is just for payments of assets and services and the repayment of debt. I think you now know enough to go to the following session:

Where do we use money for?!
