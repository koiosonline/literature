# BC-1.4.4 The fiat experiment (1/2)


## Introduction 
As mentioned in the introduction: I am a lecturer/researcher, and I research New Finance related topics. So when I start talking about "Fiat experiments", I'm getting a bit out of hand. For which I apologize in advance ðŸ˜Š. I tried to be brief, but while covering the basics of this vast and vital topic. 

Suppose you do wish to learn more about this topic? Lucky you, we will offer more deep-dive sessions later to explain the entire monetary system and how money works. If you can't wait, just read the book [the end of banking]( https://www.amazon.co.uk/End-Banking-Credit-Digital-Revolution/dp/3952438510?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-brave-uk-21&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=3952438510). But for now, try to hang on. When you are not economic, try to grasp the main idea of this session. Because these 'fiat experiments' were most likely one of the main reasons why Bitcoin started in 2008.

So the [fiat experiment](http://woodcoin.info/2019/02/26/the-grand-fiat-experiment-in-2019/)" ...What am I talking about? 

The fiat experiment is an experiment with a form of money that is based on trust. Trust in this case in a government. Fiat is also called "[government trust money]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money)".  A "trust" money, just like all our other current money, has no "[intrinsic value]( https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp)". It only counts as money because we deem it valuable. Money is an institution, a story we humans tell each other and in which we believe. This story changes over time and differs per culture. The fiat story is a story of trust in your government. Whatever happens, the government will take care of the money. Butâ€¦â€¦that is not exactly how this all played out with commercial banks swooping in and central banks printing infinite amounts of money while salaries remained the same. 

In this session, we will start with the creation of our current money (high level). Then, we finish with a description of possible risks in a centralized digital cash environment. 

## So the first one is up!  How do we create money? 

Let's start with a question: who do you think creates the most amount of our current money? 
A) The central bank
B) The government 
C) Commercial banks
D) Nobody 

Wellâ€¦as you might have guessed, it isn't D. It is also not our government (B), so we got central banks or commercial banks left.

So once more: who creates the majority of our moneyâ€¦?
Central banks or commercial banks? 

Commercial banks are, on average, responsible for approximately 95% of the money creation. So the money we use on a day-by-day basis is commercial bank money. It does have the same denominator ("dollar" or "euro"). Still, instead of backing by central banks, this money is backed by commercial corporations, which doesn't always play out all that well. As seen in 2008 and as we are currently witnessing in 2021. 

There is a difference between physical cash (central bank money) and digital (commercial bank money). Central banks create physical cash, but digital money only exists in the ledgers of banks. They can "print" it, almost as much as they want, with some restrictions.

> ðŸ’¡  Are you seriously telling me that the money we mostly use daily is created by commercial entities, mainly consisting of 5-6 big players? Yes, unfortunately, I am. The banks have played this centralized ledger game for quite some time and became very good at it. 

But how do they do that? There are limitations. But I will show you how you can do this via something called [shadow banking]( https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shadow-banking-system.asp). New digital technologies and the internet accelerated this, making the monetary system from the 20th century unfit for the 21st century. Watch [these four first clips](https://www.youtube.com/user/PositiveMoneyUK) in the further reading. 

## Let's start with the very beginning 
Let's begin once more with accounting. I will start with the recording (of value) in a double-entry accounting system. So in a "double-entry accounting system," you do nothing more than entering each transaction twice. If you buy or sell something, you will enter this single transaction twice. So, in other words: if I want to have a loan for a house of â‚¬1,000,000, I'll go to the bank and ask them for the EUR 1,000,000, which I will pay back over a certain period. 

Bank: "No problem, we will give you the money".

They won't give me a good old fashioned bag of cash anymore. Banks now only need to create a new digital identity because we entered the digital age with the internet, digital databases, and ledgers, etc. Just another name in their administration. They will state EUR 1,000,000 in my name. And digitally "transfer" money to my name. **THIS IS NOT MONEY THAT COMES FROM SOMEWHERE. IT IS AT THAT MOMENT THAT THE 1 MILLION IS CREATED IN THE LEDGER. SO NO TRANSFER, BUT A CREATION.**

> ðŸ’¡  Just like bitcoins are created each block, the banking system makes money with each new asset (like a mortgage). Banks know this and accept this from each other. Also known as the 'banking consensus protocol'. 

So all of a sudden, I am a name in a ledger, and I have EUR 1,000,000 behind my name. That money wasn't there before! EUR 1,000,000 created out of nothing (so once again: it wasn't there before!). 
On the other hand: the banks need to record every transaction twice. Remember? Double-entry accounting. So on one side of the "balance sheet" (= the bank's financial books) records my name with the EUR 1,000,000. I own that money and will use it to buy a house. So it is a self-created debt for the bank. But they also have a claim on me: I need to pay them back! If I don't, they still own my house, as stated in the mortgage contract. So not only do I need to pay back the full amount of EUR 1,000,000, but also a bit of interest. So let's say I will have to pay back EUR 1,100,000 in total. This includes a bit of interest, compensating the bank for a few risks, like not paying back. So the bank created an extra EUR 100,000 there. And the original EUR 1,000,000 only exists in the ledger of the bank! So even if I pay back the 1,000,000 (= delete the debt-money), where did the additional 100,000 come from? 

## Fractional Reserve Banking 
And not only that: as soon as they have a claim on me, an asset worth 1 million, they are allowed to lend out more money to others. Here kicks in the "beauty" for banks. Banks have something called the "multiplier", which enables banks to multiply their assets. In other words, the saying that "you can spend money only once" doesn't apply to banks. They can spend money not once, but ten times!  And in this case, they don't have money. They own an asset; they own me. I have a legal obligation to pay the bank their money back (+ interest), so they have a legal right (=asset) to receive the money from me. In other words: if I don't pay up, they will sell my house, which serves as a backup. 

But hold one? You just mentioned that although they don't have money on their balance sheet, an asset (me paying back in the future), they can still lend out money (which isn't there). And not only that? Can they do it tenfold? 

Yes, that is what I am saying. 

According to law, banks are allowed to [multiply their assets]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier) on the debit side tenfold. In Europe x10. They can now lend another additional EUR9,000,000 to other people (extra!) because they have me and my house as assets in their books (ledgers). This is also known as [fractional reserve banking]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking). Fractional reserve banking is a system in which only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by assets on hand and available for withdrawal. This is done to expand the economy by freeing capital for lending theoretically. The opposite, where every dollar is backed, is called a [full reserve banking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking). 

In fractional reserve banking, it is way easier to lend out money. So banks can now lend ten times the amount of one asset. This is to stimulate consumption and expand economies. They are allowed to do this because, in theory, not everybody will simultaneously ask the bank for their money back in cash. In practice, this systemic failure does happen and is called a bank run. If everybody would go to the bank at this very moment and ask for their money, they would learn that there is not enough money (cash) to get out of that banking system. In other words: if you lend out EUR 10,000,000 and everybody wants to take that out in physical cash, they will see that the physical cash is not there. Nor is there any gold for those who think that our money is backed by gold. The money only exists in the ledger, as a debt from the bank to their customers. Therefore also known as "[debt-based money](https://mises.org/library/our-money-based-debt)" (= nearly all our current money is debt-based, that only exists in ledgers of commercial banks).  

Back to the multiplier because it can worsen, physical cash is just an example of an asset. So the bank needs to hold 1/10 of its liabilities in assets. But it got worse here: derivative products, called very imaginative [derivatives](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-derivative-and-how-do-derivatives-work-358098), are also assets. Or other debits are assets. And this is where it went [wrong in 2008]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0BHAD4tQwQ). In short: if somebody owns five houses, of which two are in the name of their dog or goldfish, you also have five assets/claims on a person. But lucky you, you can bribe rating agencies and mix these faulty assets with decent assets. Give them fancy names like CDO's and other complex abbreviations. You can create all kinds of shitty assets and use them as assets to sell for profit or use them as backing. Just watch the movie "the big short" if you want to learn about faulty derivatives. [Very entertaining movie]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgqG3ITMv1Q)! [Also, see this explanation]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9YLta5Tr2A). 

No lessons have been learned so far, and the situation even got worse nowadays. The banking consensus, which stems from the industrial age, seems not sustainable in the digital age. The controls don't work, the legislation fails, and opinions rise, just like the printed money supply increases exponentially. And with that, house prices, stocks, gold, bitcoins, etc. The only thing that doesn't rise is salary. So the people without assets are pretty much screwed because prices rise and earnings stay the same. In the Netherlands, you can very well see this in the house markets where it is nearly impossible to buy a house as a starter. We won't dive any deeper for now. Still, you can imagine if you have inflated assets like backing for your outstanding loans, it asks for trouble. 

If you lost me, you have one asset on your balance sheet's (left) side. You are allowed to lend out ten times the amount of that one asset. So if I have 10 euros in my pocket, I can lend out that 10 euros to ten different people. I have a massive problem if they all come back to me and say: "I'd like to have the 10 euros." This usually doesn't happen. That's why this fractional system is allowed. And when it does happen, governments step in (more later). 

## Commercial banks can take enormous risks. 

As a bank, I can lend out as many as I want. I don't hand them over the cash. The cash remains in my pocket. I only digitally transfer the money from my bank ledger. And that is the trick here: I now created EUR 100 in debt money, based on EUR 10 real (physical) money. Remember that I still have a problem when they ask me for their actual money.

This is also one of the reasons why the yellow vests in Paris called out to everybody to get cash out of the ATMs to bring down the banking system. The money isn't there, so the system would crash. What happened eventually? Banks in Paris limited the max amount of withdrawing to EUR 150 per day.
People could only take out EUR 150 per day during the riots in Paris (even none in the more recent Hong Kong riots). Because of this fractional banking reserve system can crash the banking system by getting the "real" money out. So it is vulnerable in that regard. This is one of the reasons why cash is disappearing, reducing the physical opt-out risks for banks (and decreasing your opportunity). 
 
So not only can I keep EUR 10 physical cash as an asset, but I can also create a derivative of that (derivative = derived from the original financial product). Let's say a good friend of mine is also a bank. We could say: "If I lend you 1 million and you lend me one million, I will have a claim on you for a million and you on me". So I have that claim on my friend in my pocket. Not as cash but as an intangible asset. I can still lend out 10 million more. It doesn't need to be physical cash (or another physical/tangible asset!). It can also be an (intangible) claim on somebody else. The other party has a claim on me (and can lend out x10 as well), which is how we create digital debt-based money. Although banking restrictions have decreased the types of assets, you can use the multiplier. The fact remains that we have an FRB system.  

We will do a deep dive session later on here (on Koios). It is challenging to remain on this high level without getting into the details. But it all ends up in approximately 98% debt-based money creation by commercial banks worldwide. This is an unhealthy system for multiple reasons other than centralized risk factors. Watch, for example, [this video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzCegQVljdY) explaining how this system is partly responsible for widening the gap between the rich and the poor. The tricky thing here is that both cash and money in bank ledgers are denominated in EUR. Therefore, they look very similar to the EUR in our hand. This is because banks promise to exchange every EUR in the bank account for a note in your hand. They legally have to do this, allowing them to name the currency in the bank ledger and EUR). But it is a totally different thing. The 10 EUR in our hands (cash) is backed by the European Central Bank (ECB). The EUR 10 on your bank account is supported by the promise that the commercial (and enormously risk-taking) banks will payout in the future. For example, when you take the money out via a cash ATM. So these are different types of money, but both are called the same ("Euro" or "Dollar" etc.). 

>ðŸ’¡ Realize that the money in your bank account is not your money. It is a debt from the bank to you, a claim you have on the bank. If the bank goes broke, you will lose the money. Governments, like the Dutch one, will cover your losses up to 100.000 EUR.  

Take a second here: I just explained that the money in your bank account isn't yours. It is the banks, but they promise to pay it to you when you need it. For example, just like a coupon for a store. Not only that, they have less than 10% backed by assets (and even the 10% might be overvalued, as we discovered in 2008). Because what do you think banks do with the money? They buy assets, inflating prices. If they go broke, you are covered up to â‚¬ 100,000. The government will step in to cover for banks (which is convenient for banks, allowing them to take even more risks). 

## Why is this a problem, and wasn't it during the first half of the 20th century? 

Because of digitalization and the internet, banks now operate on a way more complex and larger scale. Digital assets are easily created. Way easier than gold ðŸ˜‰.  Since the mid-20th century, we can now also trade currencies against each other on foreign exchanges (the "ForEx"). This resulted in every country inflating (extensively "printing") more money. More of the currency, pumping more money in the system, losing more and more connection with assets we deem valuable like houses, companies, etc. Estimations say that the real economy is valued about 85% lower than the current monetary supply. And this difference is getting bigger and bigger because of these extreme forms of money creation. Enfinâ€¦â€¦more about this later ðŸ˜Š 

>ðŸ’¡ Money is created by centralized commercial banks and mixed up with central bank money with the same denominations. 

The debt is increasing, so everybody is lending to each other, and there is not much to back it up (< 20%). So in 2008, this bubble shook, governments stepped in with taxpayer's money (and inflation!!). Satoshi referred to this in the first block (Genesis block) by adding the headline of the London Times of that day: Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks. This was most likely one of the main reasons to create global sound money, bitcoin, which can't be printed by a centralized authority. And which is owned by the owner of the private key in a shared ledger.
