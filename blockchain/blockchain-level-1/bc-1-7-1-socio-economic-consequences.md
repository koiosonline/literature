# BC-1.7.1 Socio-economic consequences


What impact will this technology have on humans' social and economic behavior when we rearrange trust and new forms of scalable governance? We are recreating our future social and economic networks. For that, we need ethics, ladies and gentlemen. If we restructure societies, we need to take our biases into account. Ethics keeps us straight. 

## An example of ethical decision making
A perfect example is an automated car from Tesla. For the very first time in history, we need to encode certain ethical and philosophical decisions. Decisions that the vehicles will, later on, make on their own, based on our inputs and variables. 

Imagine you are behind the wheels in an automated modus. Tesla is programmed so that it needs to protect the life of the driver in all ways. A logical choice. But what happens if a red ball bounces in front of your car? The car evades it because it needs to save your life, or it runs over this ball. It makes a calculated decision based on the variables and your encoded guidelines. But what happens if a small child jumps after this ball? The car might run over the child because that statistically gives you a higher chance of surviving than when it evades the child. Or it crashes you against the wall because the child has a more extensive lifespan or higher chance of survival. Tough decision? 

"Who will die" was a philosophical debate for thousands of years. But in upcoming decades, we will need to make some choices because the car has to respond somehow. Multiple outcomes are possible in this futuristic scenario. You might even end up having two types of vehicles. You might have a Tesla Egoism, which will run straight over the child and save a driver's life. Or you might have a Tesla Altruism. which protects the child's life by evading and gives you a decreased percentage of surviving that crash. We need to program this, we need to think about this, and we need to discuss this with each other. With people who spend entire studies on it. Also, with legislators and other specialists. We shouldn't let these decisions be encoded by only a small group of people who might didn't give it a second thought. Because somebody can build something doesn't mean they thought of all the possible consequences. 

## A community-based approach
Due to the openness of blockchains, different people can enter the space where code runs in a transparent environment. Most people are not interested in blockchain technology, especially not from other fields.  But we need to aim for a balanced community to cover different angles and prevent biases from taking over in the code. A community rich in developers, lawyers, economists, ethics, artists, men/women, young/old, and cultural backgrounds. It's dangerous if you leave the decision-making in the hands of a small select group, who might only know how to write codes and understand how these algorithms work.

So luckily, we already see a lot of good initiatives starting in this regard. We see ethics getting increasingly more and more critical. And DAO's are popping up everywhere, enabling and stimulating people to join and contribute. 

## Into the Matrix
We now have the Internet of value. We can share information (copy) and value (uniqueness) on a global scale. Exciting times, with many possibilities! Open public blockchains create Commons, so we hope that we will see a rise of Commons. A shared pool of resources that we can use as humanity. Things seem to move fast for these shared services, as shown in the previous class with a few dapps examples. If we sci-fi a bit, we already talked about predictable behavior (Augur). But also in the further reading with Elon Musk & Harrari about behavior based on bio-AI and particular predictable conduct.

Combine these smart AI's with the Bitcoin suit where your body can mine, by the movement of your body where you create energy. So by the power produced by human activity, you are sustaining a decentralized network that cannot be shut down. So the network is basically "feeding" on human energy (when wearing a bitcoin suit like that). So here it gets interesting: if you launch an algorithm that's very "smart" (deep learning), on a network like that, that sustains itself on the energy of humans... You already removed all the thresholds to run across the globe. Nothing can stop it because it's an unstoppable decentralized ledger. There are incentives in place to keep the network alive. And if it's more intelligent than us humans, you can create something either beautiful or something hazardous. Remember the importance of ethics right ðŸ˜Š?! Without thresholds, without boundaries of countries, without limitations. Where information is freely accessible for global algorithms that can predict and analyze behavior before it happens, such an algorithm might know you better than you do yourself. Imagine this world, and add virtual connection via VR-tech. So does this self-sustaining, digital world, feeding on human activity, sound [familiar]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkhXLgu-mYM)? 

## Two worlds
We now have the power to create entirely new worlds that live on their own outside this physical world. Since we are migrating more and more into a digital realm, we need to think carefully about the consequences. We need to think twice before we start building things. That's why we need more balanced ecosystems! So whether you have no IT or technical background, or where you don't feel like a mathematical prodigy.........The ecosystem sincerely needs you! It's tremendously hard to recreate a world like this after it has been created. It might even take another fifteen hundred years to reinvent this world. So bear with us and use this knowledge you now have. Use this education we offer and apply yourself! You have a chance and choice to make here. Our offer is to build for the Commons and use your energy, mind, skills, and network for the better. Become part of the paradigm shift, and recreate better digital worlds. Help create new Commons.

## Portfolio assignments 1.7.1 Socio-economic consequences

What do you think the socio-economic consequences of blockchain technology will be, 10 years from now? Why? Where do you agree and where do you disagree with the opinions from the video? 
(= combination with the learning goal of this chapter: illustrate examples of how blockchain technology influenced society already, described from different perspectives, and how it might impact the future).
