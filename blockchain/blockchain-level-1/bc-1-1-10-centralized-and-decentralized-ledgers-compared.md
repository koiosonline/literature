# BC-1.1.10 Centralized and decentralized ledgers compared

This session is more of a recap, so we will all be on the same page. You should now know what a distributed, decentralized ledger is. You know that TTP controls centralized ledgers. That they have these three risks: dishonesty, exclusion, and loss of records. And they also create "walls". They operate in closed-off environments. Where a decentralized distributed ledger does the opposite, it works in an open environment. 

> üí° A centralized ledger is somebody's ledger. A decentralized ledger is everybody's ledger. 

The decentralized version is therefore inherently inefficient in its design. Moreover, a decentralized ledger has coordination problems. In other words: there are a lot more parties with whom to collaborate! However, these challenges can be solved, as Bitcoin proved last decade. Note: not a perfect solution yet! But by design, their centralized ledgers counterparts harbor the three main risk categories. These risks cannot be solved without sacrificing centralized power (governance).

The question you often hear is, "Do I need a blockchain?". It is a manifestation of another question: "based on the nature of the data we record, are the three downsides of centralized ledgers acceptable"? If you are responsible for making this choice, the answer is hopefully yes. Because then you could use a simple centralized ledger. But sometimes, the answer is no: dishonesty, exclusion, or data loss is unacceptable. Nor if it was undesired to have a monopoly/cartel in place. In those cases, you probably need to start thinking about decentralized solutions. For all other versions, you are most likely better off with a more centralized version. That is, for now, and based on the current status of decentralized technology. The inefficiencies might reduce based on progress in the technology (which is moving fast!).

A good example is money. It is, in my opinion, unacceptable to exclude people or show dishonest behavior. Or control people and their data by reviewing their money transactions. So, in my opinion, it is intolerable to have centralized ledgers in control over our money.
Therefore I opt-in for a decentralized version when we are talking about money. But suppose we are talking about bananas on the blockchain. In that case, dishonesty is still nasty, but it isn't a life or death scenario. The answer might change in the future, based on progress in technology. But let's try to tackle the more significant problems first: decentral money & governance. 


Although centralized ledgers are more efficient in their design, their design also limits their capabilities. For example, limits to a physical location or a jurisdiction. IMPORTANT to understand the following concept --> 

> üí° Centralized ledgers are more efficient in design than decentralized ledgers. Centralization requires fewer people to reach a consensus. However, Centralized ledgers are bound by restrictions like borders of countries or laws, which makes them eventually inefficient on a global scale. 


So they are limited by design because they are centralized. You can stop a TTP from doing stuff by sending an "angry letter to the CEO". So yes, centralized ledgers are more efficient. But they are only efficient in the region they can cover, which is limited because of external entities like laws. Like Facebook isn't allowed in China. Or that the banking system is so fragmented due to legislation. 

The inefficiency of centralized ledgers used to be perfectly fine during the industrial age. The scale was much smaller and often not global. But now, because of increasing digitalization and globalization, a new question arises. Which one is more efficient in design? In one corner, we have many different centralized ledgers trying to connect, but which are bound by limitations. Limitations are either internally opposed ("we don't want to share info") or externally ("you are not allowed to operate in country X). In the other corner: one inefficient decentralized ledger. But one that covers the globe and is not bound by those regional limitations? 

> üí° The answer depends on the category/use case you pick. 


But when you select the money category, the answer seems clear. Bitcoin can transfer money on average in 5 minutes to the other side of the world for $0,10. And even faster and cheaper thanks to the implementations of the Lightning Network Layer (stuff for later). Centralized banking systems can do the same in 5 working days with a fee of 10% or losing your money between ledgers (this can happen). And you would still be lucky because you have access to the system and a large part of the global population has not. 

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac">‚ùì How many people in the world are 'unbanked'? And what are their reasons? </blockquote>


## The golden (c)ages of banking
The banking ledger in the west seems faster for local activities like buying your cup of coffee. But it only seems that way. The merchant is paying a 2-3% fee per transaction. And at least five intermediaries progress the payment, making it slow and expensive in the back end. Due to the complexity, fragmentation, and (legal) limitations, the innovation moves slowly. Especially when you compare this with decentralized developments. For example, the Bitcoin Lightning Network potentially offers (nearly) free instant settlement. 

And don't forget the centralized risks. Banks were building walls last centuries. The entry requirements resulted in world dominance of value transfer (some might say a [banking cartel]( https://aantonop.com/escaping-the-global-banking-cartel/), where the entire system is in the hands of 5-7 big players). It is not easy to enter the golden cage that surrounds banks. Try to set up your official bank and discover the hassle üòâ 

But as often is the way with things: nothing lasts forever. Nor did this financial banking dominance. The rest of the world [didn't sit still]( https://decrypt.co/9639/andreas-antonopoulos-bitcoin-will-destroy-the-golden-cage-of-banking). People created ways to transfer value with each other outside the walls of the bank's castles. Everybody can play the bank on the Bitcoin Network. Barriers that previously kept people out now prevent banks from innovating. The courts with walls have a hard time competing with innovative open, decentralized ledgers. Or with commercial entrants like Facebook and other Data Giants. Note: Facebook plays an exciting role in this all. Not only did they truly wake up banks with >1 billion users and progress the CBDC movements across the globe. It also show-cased the downsides of the centralized approach. Although having global coverage, Facebook's token instantly got banned in multiple countries. A single point of attack: write an angry letter with a government stamp to Mark Zuckerberg. 

You could understand that more and more voices would like to loosen regulation from inside and outside banks. To let go of the golden cages. But also losing the protection banks enjoy, creating more open markets. For example, open markets where the extreme risk-taking behavior with derivatives isn't deflected on taxpayers üòä. One of the possible routes for banks to survive is to step out of the cage by letting go of legislation. Move into the open markets with no entry barriers and where you suffer the consequences of your mistakes. But where you can also adjust your strategy and business models to changing demands of the 21st century. Although diminished, you could still offer some benefits as a TTP. But that is not up to them, but legislators.

## The future of data?
Organizations are not (yet?) accustomed to a new possible generational mindset of transparency. Often the business model is "this data is mine, and I will not show it to you to protect my profit". Will future generations accept this now the technology could support transparency? And will they demand full transparency, like revenues per transaction, or partially, like providence? 
This requires a fundamental shift in thinking and society. Although it will take some time, a future with radical transparency is now possible. The technique seems almost ready for it. Change of hearts, minds, and behavior might follow.

## On a more personal note
It might be wishful thinking, but I want to say that you shouldn't rule out people's hunger for change and desire to improve their personal life. I am in it for the long run and want to build for the Commons. I believe this is the more sustainable way forward for all. Okay, not for all. Not for the centralized Mega Corps. But why am I of this opinion? 

In open environments, the transaction cost efficiency and the micro-incentives for the public to participate are higher. Openly available infrastructures will be cheaper. But also faster and more accessible to play with. An environment in which you can earn yourself. Because you own your data, and you own the infrastructure. A level playing field, where you learn from each other. By removing the intermediaries in decentralized systems, you remove thresholds. Thus, we move more towards the "zero-transaction-costs'' ledger. You create more freedom of choice for the individual. And that's what it might be all about: personal freedom and better connections with those surrounding you. This improvement in the ledger might do the trick.

> üí°  We used to be spread across the globe, not well connected. But internet and blockchain technology allows for large groups to organize and align incentives. Thus, it is resulting in the small fish versus big fish scenario.

## Conclusion
* **Benefits centralized over decentralized**: a coordinating TTP currently works faster and is **more efficient (in limited areas!)**. Because you only have one party that determines the truth instead of 10.000 entities. Centralized ledgers are often the better choice when you can trust your TTP and remain in a specific area. A centralized solution is preferable when trust in TTP outweighs the cost of the decentralized inefficiency.

* Do keep in mind that centralized ledgers are very limited since they are closed-off ledgers owned by TTP. In addition, this model often doesn't scale very well because every TTP has its own privately maintained catalog. In many cases, the sum is more significant than its parts. 

* **Benefits decentralized over centralized**: although coordination about the truth between parties cost effort (money, time, energy), **by removing the trusted Third Party (TTP)**, you remove the single point of failure, **reducing the three main risk categories** and leveling the playing field which has a multitude of benefits.  

* Examples of benefits decentralization
No censorship resistance and personal freedom of speech (money is a language)
Control your data, no lack in privacy and earning money with your self-sovereign data 
Immutability, the history can't be altered. 
Transparency & SSOT 
Freedom of choice & openly accessible
More secure, less single point of failures
Scalable governance models (fewer limits, new forms of governance)
Different wealth distributions
New forms of sharing information & Less information asymmetry

* So now what‚Ä¶.? Decentralization of all business ledgers and "tokenize the world"? Not so fast! Although much more secure, blockchains are still very inefficient tools. Therefore, not every use case is suited for a blockchain. 

* Therefore, let's first see how a blockchain works on one node to better understand the technology and possibilities. Then, after we showed you how blockchains work in an example of only one node, we will show you how Satoshi gathered a set of tools. And how he created consensus rules, which are used to determine how to reach consensus between all the different nodes. We will also show you the (very important!) benefits, but why this is inefficient compared with centrally coordinated ledgers. 


## Portfolio assignment 1.1.10 Centralized and decentralized ledgers compared 
Research online into at least three blockchains. Determine whether a blockchain could be a suitable solution for the problems these projects describe. Is decentralization needed, or is using a (partially) centralized ledger a better solution?
