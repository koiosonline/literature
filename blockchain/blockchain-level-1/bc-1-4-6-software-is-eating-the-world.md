# BC-1.4.6 Software is eating the world


The fourth example of why we think blockchain technology is fundamental: [software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). We've discussed this many times before. The bottom line is that software is getting increasingly more and more important in our lives. Just compare your phone & laptop apps versus apps ten years ago. Not only because the ledgers are getting more and more important in our lives, but the software running from those ledgers also gets a stronger hold in our lives. Just imagine a world without the use of software applications? This (software) benefits us, bringing us into a new (digital) dimension. But because they are running on a trusted third party ledger, this also incorporates the three risks.

A risk that we haven't discussed is that software is often biased. Developers write it. The code is not neutral and contains preferences. Humans write that code, so humans have a particular framework, a certain mindset. Often it's not a multidisciplinary approach of creation, with no multiple views on how to solve a specific challenge. People with a specialism usually create it for coding. Still, specialisms like ethical or legal frameworks could be ignored. So what we seem to need are more women in the field. We also need more artists, more ethics, etc. We need a far more multidisciplinary approach to software creation to create solutions for the challenges we all face. Examples of [biased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXuJ8yQf6dI&feature=emb_logo) software, like [discriminating algorithms]( https://brightthemag.com/googles-algorithms-discriminate-against-women-and-people-of-color-578abb8a47c1). 

Another part of the multitude of software and the data it generates is letting different algorithms do their analysis. You can collect data about entities. Compare the amount of data you generate in 2020 versus the data in 2010. And what about 2000? Or even 20 years ago. All this data is gathered and assessed in data silos. Algorithms can be fed more data and make better predictions like human behavior. Unfortunately, our current AI's are not that multidisciplinary. Ethics, philosophy, legality are all dire fields to add in this regard.

>ðŸ’¡  The data you produce is also a form of currency. With web3 tools, you can own that currency yourself. 


## Portfolio assignment 1.4.6 Software is eating the world   

1. Write a short essay of min 500 words and a max of 1,000 words of what you think the next industry will be digitalized via software. Other than explaining why you believe applications will replace this industry, describe how it would look like (what it will do) and how it might improve the current industry. Also include in your answer: Is this application possible to work better in a decentralized manner?  

2. What did you think of the opinions and visions about interconnectivity expressed by Elon Musk and Joe Rogan in the interview (see further readings)?

3. Prove ownership of this chapter's learning goal (free format): I can state why I think blockchain will or will not play an essential role on the world stage and in my personal life.
