# BC-1.1.11 Ledgernomics recap

We will do a short quick overview of what we just discussed, chapter "1.1 Ledgernomics". 

What we did in the very first section, section 1.1, is discuss this new ledger technology. We discuss distributed decentralized ledgers and what the difference was between centralized ledgers. The keynotes here are the importance and the role they play within current day society. The downsides of centralized variants are (1) dishonesty, (2) loss of records, and (3) exclusion. The downsides of distributed ledgers: it is hard, without a coordinating party,
to order transactions on time and to tackle the faulty nodes.

These two things compared make a centralized ledger often more efficient. But in a limited area. Versus a more inefficient decentralized ledger system, but which might be more efficient in a more extensive area depending on the use case. Suppose you compare that more extensive size of a decentralized ledger with all these efficient smaller ledgers on a global scale. In that case, the decentralized one is eventually more efficient (although in design inefficient). This goes for the monetary systems, but it all depends on the use case / what you are recording. The ledger of WhatsApp, for example, is more efficient than a decentralized variant can currently (!) offer. But for how long do we want to keep these data giants to become more and more powerful and play a more critical role in our lives? 

Why are decentralized ledgers inefficient in design? Because we need some time to catch up with the single source of truth / to reach consensus! It is an exciting time. We are on the front end of creating new forms of ledgers. As we've shown you, this possibly creates new societies. With new forms of governments, new states of trust, new economies. We might now have a shot to solve some of the problems with the commons.
