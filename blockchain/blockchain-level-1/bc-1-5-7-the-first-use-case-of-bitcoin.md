# BC-1.5.7 The first use case of bitcoin 

Bitcoin, the money app! First use case. I like this one because people often think that the first use of bitcoin is decentralized money, cross borders transferring, self-sovereign, etc. But basically, the very first use case of Bitcoin is to incentivize miners ðŸ˜Š! 

Let's reverse the decentralization process. Let's start with the ending point. What is our end goal? We need a decentralized ledger without a trusted third party for reasons stated before (dishonesty, etc.). So we need to compensate others for the role that a TTP usually takes care of: registering transactions and securing the ledger. 

So if we reverse it and start with a ledger without a trusted third party, what we need to do is: we need to reach a single source of truth. So without a TTP, but with consensus between different peers about the valid state of the chain/ledger? Security and validating trust in that regard are paramount. Without those, you can stop doing what you're doing. 

So you need to have a proven history, which you can't alter. And an unalterable record needs to be secured, and that security costs money. Usually, this is done by a trusted third party. But we can't use those, so we need to incentivize others. Who takes care of our past, who records and validates transactions? The miners! (and nodes safeguard the blocks). Mining costs money (mining = validate and record transactions + solve computer power puzzle).

>ðŸ’¡ So mining needs to be rewarded and incentivized, hence ladies and gentlemen, the very first use case of Bitcoin: Incentivize these miners.

After you've secured the ledger, then you can start thinking about the real end goal once more: "what are we going to use this decentralized ledger for?" That we will do in the next session! 

## Conclusion
The first use-case of bitcoin is to incentivize the bitcoin miners to validate and record transactions and secure the network.
