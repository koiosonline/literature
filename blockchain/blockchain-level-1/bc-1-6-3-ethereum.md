# BC-1.6.3 Ethereum


Ethereum! World's second-largest open public blockchain. Announced in January 2014, running for five years. What does it do? It offers a platform to create decentralized software. It provides more flexibility than Bitcoin. But comparing Bitcoin with Ethereum is like comparing a shark with a lion. They're not competing because they both have other use cases. Where Bitcoin mainly focuses on sound money and the money application, Ethereum focuses on restructuring governance.

## How does Ethereum reform governance? 
The automated smart contracts, as discussed before, are based on a public ledger. In other words: removing a trusted intermediary and creating entirely new possibilities like decentralized forests, etc. I won't get into all the nitty-gritty parts here at an introductory level. We will discuss this in detail later. 

But what you do need to realize for now is that Ethereum is a "smart contract" platform. It offers way more flexibility than Bitcoin. The Bitcoin script is, deliberately, quite limited. Vitalik Buterin and his team, the founders of Ethereum, discovered this quite soon. They tried to build a variant of Ethereum once before on Bitcoin (called "Master coin"), where they tried to build this dapp concept on Bitcoin. They quickly found out that Bitcoin wasn't flexible enough. It focuses on security instead of flexibility.


Hence, the need of another but different public blockchain was needed. Some of the concepts, though, are still like Bitcoin and some of the properties like removing the intermediary, open-source, proof of work as consensus, etc. In addition, Ethereum supports decentralized applications and therefore offers a chance to reform governance.

Aka the way, we trust each other (governance = how do you govern processes). Ethereum enables us to trust each other without a trusted third party. Instead of the trusted third party, we trust the transparent code encoded in a decentralized global ledger. So, we don't need to trust intermediary parties to record the transactions. We don't need humans anymore to create simple decisions trees (like betting or ordering a cup of coffee). We code it in the software, encode the data, and run the route on its own based on the input you give it. 

So Ethereum is a platform that runs on an open public blockchain. It enables the running of smart contracts, decision trees / programmed routes that act on input. In other words: if you combine a lot of these smart contracts/routes altogether, you have built an app. Because this app is decentralized, these apps are also known as dApps (decentralized applications). Apps that harbor all the benefits of the decentralized infrastructure reduce centralized three risks, open environments, and open-source innovation! 

Since the complexity of this topic and the already lengthy introductory level, we decided that it is enough informational background for now. So, we moved the deep dive sessions to later levels. We will finish this topic in the next session, discussing the possible use cases of dApps and Ethereum. Remember though: just as Bitcoin needs to focus on getting the money application right, Ethereum needs to focus first on getting the governance right. Because when you introduce flexibility in a blockchain, you also introduce some other forms of risks. This technology, the smart contract platforms, are just Bitcoin in its very infancy. New world possibilities, but infancy phase. Let's go to the use cases in the next course. 

## Conclusion
Ethereum is a platform running on a distributed decentralized ledger that enables you to build or use applications. Again, you can see it as an app store on your phone, only this time with no TTP (no Apple, no Google, etc.), and this time you can not only instantly download the apps but create and upload them as well. In addition, each app will harbor the benefits of a decentralized ledger, so you can, for example, earn money with your data in those apps. Since the software is getting increasingly more and more important in our lives and the data they produce, these dApps and their decentralized backbone offer tremendous opportunities (although being in their infancy).
