# BC-1.5.2.2 What is money 2/3



## Different properties, different money 

>ðŸ’¡ There are seven different properties. Important to realize is that mixing these properties will lead to different types of money.

You can tweak the properties, combine them, leave them out, or whatever. Various combinations in the properties above will lead to different types of money. For example, Bitcoin has a different set of properties than fiat and is therefore other money. Consequently, it is a different form of money. Note: the properties aren't fixed. They can change over time. For example, a paper note can be made more durable, or Bitcoin could be more widely accepted. 


## The properties explained 

1. It must be durable. In other words, it must go many times from hand to hand. The better the durability, the better the form of money. In this case, a paper banknote is less durable than a hump of gold. A hump of gold has been here for thousands of years. Perhaps even millions of years. But, of course, not in that form of a hump, but as some form of gold. And the paper note will not be here after multiple millions of years.

2. It must be portable: Here, fiat money scores better than gold because it is way more portable than 50 thousand pieces of gold. If it were the case, the paper note in the video would represent pieces of gold, which it doesn't because fiat money like the euro is not backed by gold (!). Fiat money is legal tender and has value because the government says so. They enforce it with force, often legal force, but sometimes armed forces as well. Fiat money is better portable than gold and, therefore, scores better (for smaller amounts). If you compare the portability with bitcoin, bitcoin is the better money in this department. You can transfer bitcoins across the world. Even better than paper money in this regard. 

3. It must be uniform. In other words: all versions of the same denomination should have the same purchasing power. So it doesn't matter if I have either this five euro piece or if I rip it in two. I can easily stick the two notes together with a bit of glue, and then it's once again worth five euros. So no problem there, no harm done (we ripped a note in the video).

4. Money can be limited in supply. By making something scarce, you can make something valuable. That is the downside of fiat if compared with gold or bitcoin. Fiat is not limited in supply. And therefore, fiat is not as valuable as gold. Even worse, actually: fiat is increasingly getting "printed" with incredible amounts. It has proven to decrease rapidly in the last ten to fifteen years. Its current form, commercial bank fiat, will probably be replaced soon by centralized bank money. Still fiat, not backed, but enforced. Note: money is not 'printed' anymore. As we've explained, banks digitally update their ledger and add a number.

5. Money should be acceptable. To act as good money, it should be widely accepted. As seen in the definition of money. Gold scores less in this department than fiat money. I can use this fiat note to pay in Indonesia. What I can't do is pay everywhere in Indonesia with a hump of gold. And neither can I do in the Netherlands. Not everybody will accept gold. And the same goes for bitcoins. It isn't widely accepted and therefore scores low in this department. 


6. Money should be divisible. The more you can devise it in smaller amounts, the better money it is. So a dollar can be divided into 100 cents, where a bitcoin can be devised in 100 million Satoshis. A hump of gold can be melted down in ounces etc. 

7. And the last one but not least: it should be interchangeable. So you should be able to exchange these notes with each other or the bitcoins (= "the unspent transactions") with each other, as I will show you later on. One unit should be viewed as interchangeable with another. So you can exchange the money. For example, if you pay five euros, you will receive two euros back if you bought something for three euros.
