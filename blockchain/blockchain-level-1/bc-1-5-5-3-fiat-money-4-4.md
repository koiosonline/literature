About a cashless society and data ownership. 

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac"> > ❓ What do you think about a cashless society? </blockquote> 

I don't think it would be wise to destroy an opt-out of the banking system. But, in all honesty, I believe it would be a terrible idea to have a cashless society with one single entity in control of our data! Cashless could work, but in my opinion, only without the three risks of centralization. A.k.a., only if it is by design decentral without power levers of control attracting the wrong people. 

> 💡 This will be a test for governments. What type of money will your government implement? 

We will see soon which governments will start implementing cashless societies: which governments will try to create their own centralized money? Probably most of them. And which governments additionally will give the decentralized monies like Bitcoin a chance alongside their currency. Which governments trust their citizens with self-sovereignty in the form of private digital money and which ones don't?


We recorded some benefits and downsides, the pros and cons of a cashless society. I do think a physical cashless society is inevitable. Still, perhaps a remnant of cash will exist on a local scale since we are already moving more and more towards digitalization. The main question here is: do we want our money, language, and forms of expressing ourselves monitored? Then go to the centralized public variants. Do we want it monitored and commercialized? Then go to Facebook’s coin (Libra). Do you want it to be hybrid, where you can partially be anonymous? Then go for open and public with partial encryption (Zk-snarks etc.). Fully anonymous? Go public-private coins (Monero etc.). Or perhaps build it on a centralized open variant? So many options, so many choices regarding our digital money of the future. Will we pick one? Will we select many and use multiple currencies? 

> 💡 In short: there are many routes we can pick regarding the digitalization of our money. Will privacy be in all of the variants, or is privacy an illusion? 

For now, we would like to challenge you to form your own opinion and think about what it would mean for you. You personally, but of course also for your children and your children's children, because monetary reformation is something that might carry a very, very long way! We are currently building the infrastructure for the future, so you might offer yourself the chance to think about this topic for more than one minute 😉
