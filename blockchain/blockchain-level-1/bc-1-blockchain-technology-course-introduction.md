# BC-1 Blockchain Technology - course introduction


## 1. Welcome!
Our half-year blockchain program consists of three levels. You are currently entering the first level. The program runs at a Dutch University called The Hague University and is open-source via the Koios platform. This very first level, "BC-1", will introduce the technology. It will shine a light on some of the essential backgrounds and core concepts. This level is introductory. But don't underestimate it: the entire course is on a bachelor's level 📜🎓 

## 2. A multi-disciplinary approach
Blockchain technology is ledger technology. Ledger technology highly intertwines in our everyday life. Therefore, this course is most likely relevant for you to some degree in your professional and personal life. Furthermore, we all have different backgrounds, skills, and interests. Therefore, we apply a multi-disciplinary perspective through this entire course. There are even multiple possibilities to create your unique route in level 3. 

But first things first. To understand the depth of this technology, you need to understand the basics. And that is done at this level, where we help you formulate a basic framework to keep you grounded in this new and exciting realm! We sometimes need to oversimplify things to develop this basic understanding. Nuances and more details will present themselves in the other levels of this course. Remember that it is very early days for digital technologies. We as a species are just touching the very first layer of possibilities. 

>💡 We don't have all the answers. This course is about finding your questions and providing you with a basic framework, mindset, and network. And have fun while joining this shared exploration for possible answers!

## 3. Help is on its way
Due to the newness and difficulty of materials, it can be challenging at times. Or the sheer size and fast-developing pace of the blockchain ecosystem can give you an overwhelming feeling. Don't worry: help is on its way. We've added all kinds of tools on Koios that will help you. For example, will you find extra literature, slides, quizzes & question, and even a debate and help button per lesson. Another pro-tip: use the video subtitles and read the chapter's literature for added nuances.

## 4. Discord community
Perhaps even more convenient than all those tools is the Discord community. There you can ask all of your questions and gain valuable insights. Just execute the following action and welcome to the club 🥂

## 5. But, but, what exactly will we do then during this level?
