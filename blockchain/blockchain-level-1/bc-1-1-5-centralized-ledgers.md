# BC-1.1.5 Centralized ledgers

So that covered the very first part: "what is a ledger". Once again: a ledger is a tool we use to record the transfer and ownership of value. We now still have decentralized or distributed to discuss. Remember? A blockchain is a "decentralized (1)", "distributed (2)", "ledger (3)". Number 3 is down. Numbers 1 & 2 are to go and are coming up!


Let's take down the first one: "What is decentralized?". To know what "decentralized" is, we will first describe "centralized". Centralization should be familiar because our lives are currently highly dependent on these types of ledgers and structures.

> üí° What is a centralized ledger? A fully centralized ledger is a ledger where an entity is entirely in control. Thus, the more power (governance) focuses on one party, the more centralized the ledger is. And the opposite: the more spread to different entities, the more decentralized the system is. Centralization and decentralization refer to levels of control. Distribution refers to differences in location.

As mentioned before, an entity can be a person, a department, an organization, a government agency, a big company, etc. It could also be that a few parties are in control. Just remember: So, there are different levels of centralization. In the example where you were on the sidelines, all the power was in your hands. That would be a fully centralized ledger with you as the Trusted Third Party (TTP). The ten people are trusting you to record their transactions decently. So the more power is concentrated into one entity, the more centralized a ledger is.

> üí° Centralized ledgers are highly incorporated into our lives. Centralized ledgers surround us. You can easily spot ledgers because you often have a unique ID that tracks your transactions. 

Without a unique identifier, maintaining structure is problematic. To follow something through a ledger, you need to pinpoint the thing. By giving it a unique ID number, this becomes possible. Given examples: phone number, bank account number, social security number, license plate. Something uniquely tied to either the entity or the tangible, touchable asset, or the intangible asset.

>üí° Before we go into the downsides and the upsides of centralized ledgers, it is very **IMPORTANT(!)** that you understand that these centralized ledgers operate in closed-off environments. Like we used to close off marketplaces with walls in the middle ages, we still do something similar in the 21st century with digital walls in digital marketplaces. Those in control of the borders all depend on what you are using. The more decentral and "open" an environment is, the fewer walls are present. 

So what does this mean? Let's review the example where you are the TTP and are recording your friend's transactions. You own the books and maintain the ledger. You can register all the transactions. The only thing your friends see: "does the ledger confirm the amount of money I have in hand?" So if I, as one of your friends, have $12 in hand, I can check the ledger "do I have $12 in my account?". But what I can't do is see what other amounts of dollars your other friends have. That knowledge is all owned by you, the centralized Trusted Third Party.

So this example is an example of a closed-off environment. We will explain why this is important and one of the considerable limitations in operating a healthy global system. I estimate you already understood that centralized ledgers are nowhere near the "perfect" version because they have multiple frictions. The TTP offers limited access, creating non-transparency, increasing transaction costs. 
>üí° The TTP has a wall built around the ledger. It could be a digital wall, but sometimes even literally is a wall. It is protecting information, safeguarding it, and closing off all that information for other entities. The reasons differ.  

Of course, TTP's can not abuse all the rules out and openly because that would strain their power. The power of the TPP is, therefore, in theory limited. Unfortunately, multiple showcases show the opposite in practice. But for argument's sake, in the example with you as a bookkeeper: let's say that your ten friends notice that you start abusing the rules. You don't abide by the agreed-upon rules. You are stealing money or making a lot of errors in your recording. They can come together and discuss whether to kick you out as the TTP and appoint somebody else. For you and your ledger, your friends are external entities. They live outside your ledger and, in this case, can force rules upon you. So, in short: external entities can enforce laws. An example in real life would be the banking rules that are forced upon banks. Banks can't do whatever they want. They have to follow a certain amount of rules ("a huge amount of rules actually and changes every 12 minutes"). 

Those were the external rules, but you could also have your internal controls. For example, when you needed to record your friends initially. You could pick whether to register them with only their first name and letter of their last name, etc. Those were your own rules. Your structure of entities and transactions makes you work more efficiently and make fewer mistakes than without those roles. These types of practices we call internal controls, forced upon from within the system. 

We will come back later on why this is important, but keep the following in mind. 
>üí° There are two types of rules in centralized ledgers to keep the TTP in check: internal protocols created by the entity itself managing the ledger, and external controls, made by the entities around you. In addition, also keep in mind for later that centralized ledgers operate in limited, closed-off environments!

Hopefully, you came across a few ledgers. As mentioned, this is relatively easy to do because you only need to visualize your daily life. They are everywhere. Which isn't a bad thing, but realize the importance. So let's say that we picture you waking up by an alarm clock. That's already hitting your first ledger there, the electricity ledger. Just open the electricity closet and find your unique number on the electricity meter if you have one. You use electricity, recorded by the meter, connected to the ledger by flipping a switch, or an alarm clock. You are transacting value: you're taking energy, which has value, and later on, you will pay the energy company the money. Which also has value. You flush your toilet = water ledger. Perhaps used your phone early in the morning = phone ledger. Perhaps used an application on that phone = connected with the application. Fun fact: if you ate breakfast and bought that breakfast at the grocery store and you paid with digital money, for example, with your bank account pass, recorded in the bank's ledger. But if you paid in cash, that transaction was only recorded in the grocery store. So the actual transfer of money wasn't recorded on your side, making cash a more anonymous way to pay for transactions, which is an interesting (and immensely valuable!) property of money. Also, note the example of friends passing along cash is therefore not very good as an example. But let's stick with it for now.
