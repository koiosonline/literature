# BC 1.5.9 Is bitcoin the future of money?

So it's Bitcoin the future of money? That's what we will discuss here! Remember: we don't have the answers, especially not about the future. But we can help you form a mental framework. Bitcoin, in short, can indeed become one of the possible futures of money. Because it can do things that other types of money can't.

## Quick recap

Historically speaking the evolution of money shows the following order:
1. Collectible
2. Store of Value
3. Medium of Exchange
4. Unit of Account

Bitcoin seems to be in transgression between phase 1 and 2. It first needs to prove itself to be a reliable store of value, not only in value, but also in non-correlation with other assets.

We have discussed  this. That something historically evolves into eventually a medium of exchange and becomes a unit of account [source]( https://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnMME.html?chapter_num=4#book-reader). So first of all, money often starts as a collectible, a rarity that's difficult to collect and that people, therefore, want to collect as Bitcoin began as well. Then it becomes a store of value because people are starting to value it. And exchange stuff for it. So that's what is currently happening. That presently seems to be the phase where Bitcoin needs to evolve from. We seem to be nearing the end of that first phase. We are gracing the surface of a medium of exchange after Bitcoin has proven itself over a certain amount of time. Just remember: plastic debit and credit cards needed multiple decades (50-60 years). Thanks to the internet and the open-source protocol, we communicate and innovate and adapt faster. Information and lessons learned to travel more quickly: Bitcoin will probably succeed faster than it took credit cards.

## A personal view on the matter
We might move towards a medium of exchange, where users (people, machines, and …?) start to exchange value/data/money on a p2p level. On a side note: we are still talking about "bitcoins", consisting of 100 million Satoshis, but eventually, we will, by my expectation, start talking about Satoshis. I expect to exchange Satoshi's for services and goods, so no more Satoshi's to fiat. The store of value, in that case, is not measured in fiat (e.g., dollars) anymore. It might even be frowned upon by future generations ("why determine the value in fiat?"). So there's no need by then to exchange it for fiat currencies. I expect that the role of our current commercialized bank debt fiat will transgress into CBDC's (Central bank money instead of commercial bank money). And I also think that will be the moment when people start to realize the difference between centralized and decentralized money (public ones like CBDC's and private ones like Bitcoin, for example). Differences in privacy, monetary policy, ownership: all dependent on the preference of the users.

## Don't lose your keys

So why should bitcoin be an attractive store of value? As mentioned before: it's deflationary. The supply is limited, and you can't alter the number of bitcoins. There are 21 million bitcoins. By current estimation, already 25% is lost. If you lose your keys to your bitcoin wallet, you lose access (which we will explain in level 2). For now: not very user-friendly if you use Bitcoin: people have lost their private keys initially (and therefore have lost their funds).

At the beginning (of Bitcoin), it was pretty easy to mine and gain many bitcoins. Nobody was sure what was going to happen. It is not hard to lose your keys. We all know famous stories about people throwing out Hardware on huge e-wastes etc. There was, for example, a guy losing 7,500 bitcoins. He needed to throw away his mining rig because his girlfriend was complaining: it made many sounds. I don't know if you have ever heard of a mining rig, but indeed it is a valid complaint (one rig sounds like seven vacuum cleaners).

>💡 With owning your own money comes great power, but also a great responsibility.



# Bitcoin is and isn't a bubble, and that is a good thing

Next topic [whether it is or isn't a bubble]( https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bubble-rants-begin-again-as-btc-booms/)? In short: it is a bubble, and it isn't a bubble. So yes, it is a bubble because every money is a bubble, and in the case of Bitcoin, the bubble already popped seven or eight times before. It isn't a bubble because it keeps on coming back. The price mainly reflects the amount of energy that backs the security, so it seems that we have for the first time in human history not only a global decentralized digital money but also one backed by value in energy. Some would state that energy is all there ever is in the universe. The backing by energy is the truest form of support (other than gold backing fiat, because what does gold do…?). This is also why I like cryptocurrencies so much: they are backed by energy and community consensus. Things that have actual value Universe-wise respectively human-wise. Also, it has transparent, predictable behavior incorporated via game theory mechanics. If prices drop, energy backing drops and vice versa. Because of the game-theoretic principles, which we will discuss in level 2, cryptocurrencies using proof-of-work reflect energy usage. We already discussed all the other reasons why it isn't a bubble already (benefits of decentralization & inter-connectivity nature).


To ask if bitcoin is in a bubble or if it is the future of money is irrelevant. It all depends on the time frame or the moment in time. The fundamental properties look very well, even better than other current monetary designs. However, still many things are lacking as well, like technical scaling, adoption, etc. The cards for the future look well for bitcoin but remember that all claims about the future are most often speculation. Just see bitcoin as a highly talented teen who might capture the world when fully in adulthood. But the road to adulthood and world coverage is challenging for any teen, even the highly talented ones.

To explain a bit further regarding the irrelevance of the question and the time. As we've seen, the price of Bitcoin measured in $, was in a bubble by the end of 2017. But if you compare that price with five years back in time or, for example, the price ten years from now, you might draw different conclusions. Or if you relate it to other currencies, other than a dollar (Argentinian Pesos, Turkish lira's, etc.). In that specific moment in time (2017 till now), you can draw that an 80% decrease might prove that the prices were in a bubble. But how about the comparison



So yes, bitcoin is also a bubble. Like all money, the story needs to adjust, and whether it is in a bubble can only be said about that moment in time: does the story that is currently told match the reflection of the value.

>💡 There is a famous quote that we 'often overestimate the potential of new technologies in the short run and underestimate them in the long run'. The beauty here is, you can directly buy this technology, so you instantly see this statement is reflected in the prices.

It was clear that the technology was overhyped in 2017. Suppose even the cab drivers and my mother-in-law start tipping cryptocurrencies before even anybody uses it. In that case, the told stories and reality don't align: it is overvalued. The opposite also happens, most often when panic happens: the story that everything is a scam or garbage and that bitcoin and crypto was nothing more than a dream don't reflect reality either. Experienced traders know this and profit. New traders (which flooded the markets in 2017) didn't know this and experienced huge losses. A lot of projects get funded which never saw daylight, deliberately (scam) or un-deliberately. It's a shame because I think it is realistic to say that it will take some time to regain trust for those who lost a lot. Don't underestimate human greed though, these stories often move in circles, and a frenzy for a new hype run is always there. Hopefully, next time we can better educate people on what to buy and when and why + what not to buy.

## Bitcoin is too volatile? 

Bitcoin’s price volatility is a function of its nascency. In the first few years of its existence, Bitcoin behaved like a penny-stock, and any large buyer — such as the Winklevoss twins — could cause a large spike in its price. As adoption and liquidity have increased over the years, Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased commensurately. When Bitcoin achieves the market capitalization of gold, it will display a similar level of volatility. As Bitcoin surpasses the market capitalization of gold, its volatility will decrease to a level that will make it suitable as a widely used medium of exchange. As previously noted, the monetization of Bitcoin occurs in a series of Gartner hype cycles. Volatility is lowest during the plateau phase of the hype cycle, while it is highest during the peak and crash phases of the cycle. Each hype cycle has lower volatility than the previous ones because the liquidity of the market has increased.

Just keep in mind in the case of bitcoin: as long as every 10 minutes the decentralized hearts keep on pounding, the ledger becomes more secure, trust increases, technical properties keep improving, adoption increases, ecosystem grows, etc. It keeps getting more robust (the value of one bitcoin is being backed by more and more energy and computational power), offering the chance to improve itself and become better and better. It is enhanced by the world via open source contributions. The direction is hard to determine. Many routes are possible because, in the end, we are sending data across a ledger, where the data can take many forms, which impacts all the different applications that are built upon the layer. Suppose you're using the data to represent money. In that case, if given enough time, it will reach a certain equilibrium with a specific volume and history to back it. But start using it for different things, other than money. If you solve the money application, it will have a diverse user base, adoption rates, and use cases. The demand increases. Then most likely, the price will increase as well because of basic economics: if demands increase, most likely the price as well (if the amounts of bitcoins are fixed). This means we start all over again with over-and under-valuations, with the starting point the monetary equilibrium.

## Fee's are too high
We want to discuss an often heard argument that the transaction fees are too high to close this session. Yes! And I hope they will always be of a certain amount on the base layer because we need to incentivize miners! If the transaction fees are meager, we need to have accomplished many transactions per block to compensate. Perfectly fine as well, but in the end, we still need to pay for the replacement of the TTP. Suppose we have free transactions on a Bitcoin network. That means that the security ranges in a different setting because proof of work requires energy, money, and investments. So we need to compensate for that. So it would help if you had either a different consensus algorithm or weak security there.

A recent criticism of the Bitcoin network is that the increase in fees to transmit bitcoins makes it unsuitable as a payment system. However, the growth in fees is healthy and expected. Miners can either be paid by transaction fees or by block rewards, which are an inflationary subsidy borne by current bitcoin owners. Given Bitcoin’s fixed supply schedule — a monetary policy which makes it ideally suited as a store of value — block rewards will eventually decline to zero and the network must ultimately be secured with transaction fees. A network with “low” fees is a network with little security and prone to external censorship. Those touting the low fees of Bitcoin alternatives are unknowingly describing the weakness of these so-called “alt-coins”.

**The specious root of the criticism of Bitcoin’s “high” transaction fees is the belief that Bitcoin should be a payment system first and a store of value later**. As we have seen with the origins of money, this belief puts the cart before the horse. Only when Bitcoin has become a deeply established store of value will it become suitable as a medium of exchange. Further, once the opportunity cost of trading bitcoins is at a level at which it is suitable as a medium of exchange, most trades will not occur on the Bitcoin network itself but on “second layer” networks with much lower fees. Second layer networks, such as the Lightning network, provide the modern equivalent of the promissory notes that were used to transfer titles for gold in the 19th century. Promissory notes were used by banks because transferring the underlying bullion was far more costly than transferring the note that represented the title to the gold. Unlike promissory notes, however, the Lightning network will allow the transfer of bitcoins at low cost while requiring little or no trust of third parties such as banks. The development of the Lightning network is a profoundly important technical innovation in Bitcoin’s history and its value will become apparent as it is developed and adopted in the coming years.



So transaction fees are indeed present, way less than what you're currently paying for international transfers. If you're comparing Bitcoin with a cross-border transactional transfer, Bitcoin is a way better option. But you often hear that the fees are too high for small transactions. Ignoring the scaling solutions currently being out there and are up & running (like Lightning Network), you need to realize that you already pay +/- 3% per transaction fee in the current system when you buy a cup of coffee. Although you as an end-user might think that your transaction is free when you buy coffee, the fee is paid by the merchant and is incorporated in the price (so you do pay for the cost by paying a higher price for the coffee). Eventually, you end up paying more in using the current banking system caused by many intermediaries than when you use a peer-to-peer transaction.
But of course, you as a user don't experience it this way. But you will see that when everybody in the world uses p2p networks, transaction costs will decrease (might lead to lower prices, depending on the merchant 😉).

Important to realize that although you think it is free to swipe your card: (1) You are transferring data and (2) you're paying two to three percent incorporated in the price, and (3) you're as Antonopoulos mildly puts it "slowly killing democracy 😊 ". But for that, I will refer you to Antonopoulos's clip, which we will upload in the further readings.

## The network effect 

And what is Bitcoin? Is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin cash, Bitcoin Diamond or Jesus, or Bitcoin SV? Or it's Bitcoin all of these different types of Bitcoin, and does Bitcoin represent choices in all these variants? In short: since the invention of Bitcoin, we have had the freedom as end-users to choose one of these cryptocurrencies.

As an open-source software protocol, it has always been possible to copy Bitcoin’s software and imitate its network. Over the years, many imitators have been created, ranging from ersatz facsimiles, such as Litecoin, to complex variants like Ethereum that promise to allow arbitrarily complex contractual arrangements using a distributed computational system. A common investment criticism of Bitcoin is that it cannot maintain its value when competitors can be easily created that are able to incorporate the latest innovations and software features.


The fallacy in this argument is that the scores of Bitcoin competitors that have been created over the years lack the “network effect” of the first and dominant technology in the space. A network effect — the increased value of using Bitcoin simply because it is already the dominant network — is a feature in and of itself. For any technology that possesses a network effect, it is by far the most important feature.

The network effect for Bitcoin encompasses the liquidity of its market, the number of people who own it, and the community of developers maintaining and improving upon its software and its brand awareness. Large investors, including nation-states, will seek the most liquid market so that they can enter and exit the market quickly without affecting its price. Developers will flock to the dominant development community which has the highest-calibre talent, thereby reinforcing the strength of that community. And brand awareness is self-reinforcing, as would-be competitors to Bitcoin are always mentioned in the context of Bitcoin itself.


## Closing note
Bitcoin enabled vast amounts of other (crypto)currencies. As you may have already noticed, we often focus on bitcoin. Of course, there are many different cryptocurrencies out there, and we will discuss all of them in later sections. But this open form of (money) competition, this open form of open sources money, means that it is a zoo of cryptocurrencies out there 😊
Everybody is competing with each other. Everybody is trying to figure out how to become "the new Bitcoin", which is difficult (in my opinion). Try to copy-paste an ecosystem that Bitcoin has, for example.


So it's more of a Hayekian approach (Friedrich Hayek). He described that creating the currency by open markets or letting people choose their currencies might decide what currency is the best one (or what combinations). So if people want to use Bitcoin Cash, they can use Bitcoin cash. If Bitcoin core offers a better store value, they pick Bitcoin Core. Let the market decide (Hayekian approach). So it's one substantial Hayekian experiment out there. For the first time in human history, we now have many options (on a global scale!!). Whether it's a good thing or not, I will leave it up for debate, but it is fair to say that bitcoin did open up public discussion about money at the least.

In the next session, I would like to take you up to one final money trip, which might be a literal trip of the mind: an economy beyond money.

## Conclusion
* In short: To ask if bitcoin is in a bubble or the future of money is irrelevant. All depends on the time frame or the moment in time.
* Regarding the time frame: the fundamental properties look very well, even better than other current monetary designs, but still many things are lacking, like technical scaling, adoption, etc. The cards for the future look very well for bitcoin regarding the innovative open-source powers. Still, they remember that all claims about the future are nothing more than speculation. Of course, the story becomes stronger and stronger. Still, it needs time to prove itself (or outstanding storytellers, because best stories that stick are often not true).
* Just see bitcoin as a highly talented teen who might capture the world when fully in adulthood. But the road to adulthood and world coverage is challenging for any teen, even the highly talented ones.
* Whether Bitcoin will capture world coverage all by itself? Most likely not, but that's up for next session 😊!
