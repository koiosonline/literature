# BC-1.6 Introduction to smart contracts

## About this chapter?
This chapter is about smart contracts, a new way to automatically record transactions in a decentralized distributed ledger without the interference of intermediaries. In such a realm, you trust the code in the contract instead of a third thrust entity. We´ll start with the network that brought smart contracts to a whole new level: Ethereum. 

## What will we discuss? 

1. BC-1.6.1 Introduction to smart contracts 
2. BC-1.6.2 Smart contracts explained 
3. BC-1.6.3 Ethereum
4. BC-1.6.4 Use cases smart contracts 
5. BC-1.6.5 “Do I really need a blockchain?” 
6. BC-1.6.6 Enter the blockchain idea maze – three theses 
7. BC-1.6.7 There is no “one-size-fits-all solution.”


## Learning goals 

By the end of this lesson, I can: 
* Explain in my own words what a smart contract is and name some of the possible use-cases (understand)
* Access a public blockchain via a web-based interface and know how to “open” a smart contract (apply)
* Model different types of answers on the question “do I need a blockchain?” partially by explaining the concepts behind the “no-one-size-fits-all-solution”(apply)
