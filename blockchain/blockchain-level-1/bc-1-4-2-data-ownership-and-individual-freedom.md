# BC-1.4.2 Data ownership and personal freedom


We live in a world where data is becoming increasingly more critical and abundant. Data is everywhere. Applications may seem freely accessible, but we pay with our data. And sometimes, we exchange freedom for censorship. Twitter is blocking persons (even presidents!), Linkedin filters posts, and Facebook manipulates elections. The list not only goes on and on but exponentially grows. TTP's control your data. For now ðŸ˜Š 

So I recently discussed whether to buy a specific productâ€”a face-to-face discussion without using any nearby applications. But within 24 hours, I received promotional activities on YouTube, Google, etc., trying to sell me that product. As you most likely will have noticed on your own: your applications are listening. And this is not only on your phone: your TV, computer, the internet. Data is collected from all kinds of devices that surround you. And that's how the data giants earn their money. 

Where's the problem with that? Wellâ€¦ Suppose you can sell people products based on their behavior and data profile. In that case, you can sell them opinions and people as well. So you can start steering people into a specific direction (sell them products / sell them political visions). Do it the rigorous and obvious way like in China. We added a clip explaining how China is currently using new technologies to steer masses of people in a particular direction. But you could also do this in a more subtle and less obvious variant. Variants that stimulate you to buy via dopamine. Think about the small red icon that tells you that you still need to read something/you still need to do something. Or the amount of time you check up on your socials and where you receive a small portion of dopamine every time you check in.  

> ðŸ’¡  If you haven't paid for the product, you most likely are the product. You often pay with your data and privacy. Sometimes those costs catch up quickly; when booking your airplane tickets. Sometimes the costs come later or are more disguised; vote manipulation, etc. 


> ðŸ’¡  A decentralized ledger is not controlled by a third party. So no third party owns your data. 
Who owns your data? Well....you! You can earn with your data.

There are applications built for this self-sovereign ownership, which we call **web3 applications**. The apps are often still immature and primarily centralized. And with a lot of deficiencies, bugs, user unfriendliness, and errors. But also with a lot of promises and opportunities. Web3 is slowly rising and moving towards a world where you're enabled to own your data! A good example is the decentralized finance scene, where monetary values represent data, and 'owning your data' means playing for the bank. 

There are exciting projects regarding this topic, which we will discuss later on. For now, watch the two short clips that we've added to this section. If you are interested: watch [The great hack]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX8GxLP1FHo), which tells you more about the dangers of data ownership by a TTP. 

We are most definitely not sure of the future course of data ownership. Still, in my opinion, we can't take these risks of limitations in freedom. Our data equals our liberty in a data-driven world. Just look at the Chinese design as an extreme example for where it can be headed regarding crowd control. 

>ðŸ’¡  The decentralized vision is to redistribute that centralized power over an ecosystem of entities. From centralized powerhouses that grow out of control to sustainable commons for all. 


## Portfolio assignment 1.4.2 Data ownership & personal freedom  
1.	What is your opinion on data ownership and the personal freedom that is associated with it? Do you mind sharing your data in return for the ability to use Facebook, e.g.? And if you are concerned, what are you prepared to do about it? Can you do something about it?

2.	Sit back and relax while watching The Great Hack. Then, record your findings in the FilmForm.
