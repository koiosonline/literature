# BC-1.5.5.2 Fiat money 2/4 – bank run and system failure

## Bank runs & Fractional reserve banking

The second example of possible risk in our current money is the concept of a [bank run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run). I experienced one firsthand myself with the former DSB in the Netherlands. Bank runs happen relatively often on a global scale. If interested, check out the source in the further readings. They logically tend to happen a lot in countries where the banks have a much less degree of trust from citizens, where banks have proven to disadvantage bank account owners over and over before. Like in Argentina, or more recently in Venezuela. 

Because we have fractional reserve banking, you can trump down any bank (more quickly than with full reserve banking) as explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa75BfmXQH4). Because of the multiplier effect, they don't have all of their outstanding debts backed in their ledger. And because the assets are sometimes intangible assets based upon another debt. If you want to learn more about intangible assets and how manipulated intangible assets caused the financial crisis in 2008, I once more would recommend watching the Big Short. 


Therefore, a bank run can be triggered by fake news sent forward via [WhatsApp]( https://www.businessinsider.nl/whatsapp-rumour-started-run-on-metro-bank-2019-5?international=true&r=US). If trust is already frail, you don't need much to steer everybody to their bank and withdraw all their money. If that happens, a bank can go bankrupt. Because there are more claims than they can facilitate, other entities (like other banks) lose trust, increasing a negative spiral. We've seen this with the DSB bank in the Netherlands. People lost faith in the bank and started transferring money (digitally, so not only via ATM runs).

## Banking crisis

Interesting and scary though is that sometimes it just doesn't only happen to one bank. You can have an entire systemic banking crisis. And that's what happened in 2008: when one bank fell (Lehman Brothers), this bank had outstanding loans and payments to other banks,
which they couldn't pay anymore. Therefore downsizing the asset side of the other banks. And thus tumbling over like dominoes. And then, all of a sudden, the banking system doesn't work anymore. What is the solution? Or what was the answer in 2008? In short (and neglecting essential details!): government bailouts from taxpayers and quantitative easing (inflating, by printing more money). 

What seems to be unfair, in my opinion, is the countermeasure of bailing out a failing bank with government money or by printing more fiat money. Both negatively affects the average citizen by sacrificing tax money and by negatively impacting the store of value of the fiat money. Eventually, when banks were back on their own feet, some of them repurchased themselves. 

The question remains whether it's a healthy thing to fix these kinds of market inefficiencies with tax money or printing money is up for discussion. 

I want to say here that if a bank fails, there's probably a reason why that bank fails. It most likely didn't have its risk assessment in order / took too many risks with other people's money. Or the bank knew that the government would back it so that it could take tremendous amounts of risks. Lehmann didn't expect a hard "no" from the government. Eventually, if you keep saving unhealthy organizations, you don't allow healthy organizations to prey on those unhealthy organizations. If you keep saving unhealthy banks in this case, other healthy banks can't benefit from the other banks' demise. 

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac"> >❓ I'm more of a fan of the more libertarian approach there: so banks shouldn't be too big to fail. Instead, cut them into small parts and let the more vital elements take over the not-well performing ones. Failure is an excellent teacher. But what do you think should the government step in when banks fail? [Remember: try to think in complementary opposites!](https://kernel.community/en/track-gaming/module-0/) </blockquote> 

## Let go of the legal jungle? 

Cutting banks lose from regulation isn't necessarily a bad thing! Because banks are now in a tricky corner, they are pretty much caught up between decentralized cryptocurrencies alternatives and other new commercial entities entering the payment scene like Facebook and Amazon and We Chat, etc. And probably more threatening: central banks are experimenting with creating their currencies. All offer payment services to some extent, offering customers alternative money, opt-out of the banking system. People already had cash to opt out of the system. 

However, banks and governments are working very hard to eliminate that option. It has proven very hard to regulate decentralized cryptocurrencies, and now a second, perhaps even bigger threat arises in the form of giant data companies entering the money scene (adding more data into their data silos). The previous rules that kept the banks alive and protected are now the rules that bind their hands (golden cage principle). It is challenging for banks to experiment with cryptocurrencies. How can they compete with a global dopamine fed Facebook coin with more than 2 billion users? In my opinion, it will be better for everyone if regulation is that the reins lose a bit and banks aren't protected anymore, but neither shackled.

To close this session, [added]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oXMGeEQfeg&feature=emb_logo) for fun. See how much gold every country currently has stored in its vaults. Not that fiat is backed by gold, you now know that it isn't anymore since 1971, but it does give a bit of insight into where one of the world's most valuable commodities lie. The video is a bit outdated. Countries have been buying a lot of gold in the last few years. Why is that, do you think?  

## Conclusion
Fractional Reserve Banking allows banks to lend out more money than they own, spurring economic growth but making the overall system more fragile. Banks previously had the support from governments or centralized banks that helped them out when they failed, protected partially by legislation. However, this same legislation prevents them from competing with new competitors, like Facebook, Central Banks, or Bitcoin. So the question remains whether to de-legislate banks, opening up the banking market, making them personally accountable for their actions, and enabling them to innovate.
