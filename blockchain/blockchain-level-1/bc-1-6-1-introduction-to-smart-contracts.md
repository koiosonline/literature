# BC-1.6.1 Introduction to smart contracts

**Probably best watch with video** 


>💡 When we talk about smart contracts, the first thing up is that a "smart contract is to a contract, as what a koala bear is to a bear". So it is not a bear, but it has some minor similarities, just as a smart contract is not smart and has some similarities with a contract. 

## An example: the coffee machine 

So, what is a "smart contract"? We are talking about programmable data so that we can program it in a particular route. This means that a "smart contract" is a "decision tree". If this happens, then we follow that direction. Or if that happens, we follow that direction. 

So, let me explain this. Do you remember the employee card of THUAS? I already checked in today, so my "status" went from offline to online. So my digital identity is connected, which gives me proof of ownership and authority (= power properties of ledgers). In this case, the authority to enable/initiate a smart contract. 

So, imagine this coffee machine being a smart contract, only physical. A smart contract always needs input(!), just like a coffee machine. So I'm going to give it input now. I'm going to determine the route that will automatically carry out (after my input). In other words: I am selecting hot water as input (= Jordi places cup and presses the button on the machine. Both are needed as input; otherwise, the machine doesn't do anything). Now I will give it my approval via a "private key" (imaginative). Or in this case, I authorize the transaction with the key (Jordi presses employee card on validating payment device). The machine starts the validation process and automatically fills the cup with tea if approved by its own rules. 

>💡 Based on the input I gave time, the machine followed a set of rules and produced output. 

## Another example – the soccer match 
In other words: based on the variables, a smart contract runs in a specific direction. Let me give another example—a soccer match where party A plays against B, where you want to bet on the outcome. In the current web2 world, you would need to go to a trusted third party, like Unibet, where you need to pass your funds to Unibet, and where this TTP will search for a peer that bets against your bet. But Unibet is still in the middle (as a centralized trusted third party). The three main risk categories are therefore applicable on Unibet: they can falsify, exclude, run away with your money, ask for a fee, it will take time, etc. 

So why not remove Unibet from this equation by using a smart contract between these betting peers. Person A and B both send money into the smart contract (instead of to Unibet). And the soccer match is about to be played. So, based on the match's outcome, the final score of the game, which is a variable input for the smart contract, is just the same as me pushing the tea button on the screen. The contract will start doing things (determining the route to be walked). Just as I can randomly select input for the coffee machine, the outcome of the soccer match also gives random input, but only in another way. 

So, let's say teddy bear A bets on Real Madrid winning and teddy bear B on Barcelona winning. In the end, Barcelona wins (for example, input contract = outcome match). So, the smart contract receives input (this time "Barcelona wins" instead of "cup of tea"). Information is obtained from the end of the game, registered on UEFA.com or FCBarcelona.com. The contract checks:  

Step 1: did I receive all the money? If yes, then step 2.

Step 2: if Barcelona wins, then I will send money to teddy bear A (automatically).
 Step 2: if Real Madrid wins, then I will send money to teddy bear B (automatically).
Step 2: Is it a tie? I will send the money back. 

You will see what this contract will do in advance because it is fully open and transparent. You can see the available routes in advance. So you know beforehand that if teddy bear B doesn't want to pay up, Teddy B's money is already locked in the contract. Which will automatically be sent in a specific direction based on the outcome of the match. 

If you have a friend that bets but never pays up, use a smart contract, and your friend can't back out of it. So, in this case, Teddy A is happy, Barcelona wins, and he doesn't pay any fees (only the miner transaction fee). It all happens on a decentralized ledger, so your data is protected. With fewer tx costs, you see where I'm going (benefits decentralized). So, we are building upon this decentralized infrastructure with new tools that automatically run themselves without the intervention of a human being.

Just as I made this cup of tea without human intervention (physical world), we can also bet on sports games without human intervention (digital world). So we are automating the software world to the next level. 

## Next phase
Smart contracting is creating and restructuring societies, such as Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAO's). Organizations that run on a public blockchain in an automated way. You can see it as an application in a decentralized world. More about this later! 

Hopefully, you now understand a bit better what a smart contract is. To be sure: we will upload a few other clips explaining smart contracts as well (way better than I just did :-)!). 

>💡 Key takeaway: a smart contract is nothing more than an automated digital decision tree. It will run itself based on the code we gave it (you write the route with code). In short: programmable data on an economic infrastructure 2.0! See you next course!
