# BC-1.5.10 An economy beyond money 

So thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto, we now have the luxury to do Hayekian experiments. As you already discovered, money can take many different forms where data is currently represented as money in the bitcoin infrastructure. People always discuss, "this form of money is better than that form of money". "My bitcoin is better than your bitcoin cash" or "fiat sucks" or "gold is the best form of money".


>ðŸ’¡ But think about this, what if there is a world without money? So how can we arrive in a world without money?! A world where there is no need for human institutions, and where humans rely on code instead of institutions. As you know, money is something we use to transact between peers. But in a perfect ledger (as discussed before), there is no need for money. Because a transaction is instantly recorded (remember the properties of the ideal ledger?). It instantly knows how much, for example, a cup is worth and how much is an eraser worth? 


But how can we exchange these assets? We currently use the money to denominate the eraser and the cup. But let's say that this cup is worth ten erasers. We could instantly transact this as well (without using money). However, then we would still have changed (what if I only need one crayon when I have one cup?), and there is also currently a certain amount of delay (in data/price) as well as in trust (will they pay up). Hence all the reasons for money to exist, it reduces these thresholds. So a "money" is used to determine the value of assets (unit of account). And is used to exchange these assets. And to increase the tx cost efficiency (remember the coincidence of wants?). 

But in a perfect ledger anymore (perfect definition ledger = ledger without tx costs). So we don't need money to reduce tx costs. Butâ€¦.all well a perfect ledger, but how does it work? What in the world would that look like? 

>ðŸ’¡ In such a world: Money = the dynamic ledger framing (connecting) the assets

So the ledger itself becomes the money. It is the ledger that provides trust between entities. The ledger calculates the live market prices (which are often stable based upon demand/liquidity). The ledger records your assets and automatically deals with your change (based upon your personal preferences, which you set). It is a ledger that continuously evolves and adjusts based on some input variables. 

So how does this exactly work? Other than the blockchain principles of peer-to-peer transactions and to reduce trust, we use some other principles in this case. So I can imagine that it is still based on demand in the future: how many people will want to buy the cup? And how many want the eraser? How many will want to sell? Currently, our systems are not created so that we can instantly exchange these things (cup & crayon). Therefore we need a bridge between these two. Reasons are lack of liquidity of the assets and technical limitations (connected asset framework, as you will see later). 

So currently, our systems need "money" to determine this exchange. But what in the world where every asset worth trading is "tokenized" (digitally represented by a token)? So, for example, an automated forest, a node, a computer, spent hours gaming. Different assets lead to different types of tokens (other "money", all framed in a framework of data assets). Imagine this tokenization of assets in a world where everything is digitalized/copied from the natural (physical) world, where people start transacting with each other, between peers. In a world like that, we have significantly "increased liquidity" for these assets to trade. Not only against one and each other but one against all. You would know the value of your asset related to all the other tokenized assets. 

What does this mean? Do we all of a sudden have a market for erasers (or crayons or cups)? Yes, some people might like to buy or sell erasers to each other, but most likely, not all assets are liquid. Increased liquidity doesn't mean total liquidity for all assets. Markets will decide where there is demand. So you have a demand, where the asset is represented by a token and where we can exchange all kinds of stuff that we couldn't exchange beforehand 
(on a peer-to-peer level). Whether you actually exchange it in the physical world is outside the scope of the exchange. The person that holds the digital assets holds ownership (or you could split the ownership in the digital variant and make that leading, like we currently did with stocks, for example). 

So I can then exchange a raspberry pie with 100 erasers or with one tree or 1,000 hours of gaming! Whatever can be digitized. You can have all different forms of the asset with increased liquidity because entities will want to buy it from you if it is valuable (transparent markets). What is valuable changes over time, but most likely, assets in the physical world remain valuable in upcoming centuries. Because all assets are publicly traded, you now have insight into the current demand (for your asset) based on that asset's real-life (!) demand.

So our current institutions, like the centralized ledgers, can't tokenize and exchange this (not real life & fully open because of the closed-off environments). Even if they did manage to build up such a framework, it would be perilous to trade all the value in the world over a centralized network (three risk categories 2.0). Another big step would be that our human minds are bound/can't cope with such a system. Stories are for us humans, machines, and algorithmic machine learning are not bound by these stories (unless we program them in such a way). Finally, we can't keep track of an entire framework of all different types of (tokenized) assets. Imagine how difficult it would be to determine the exchange price of an eraser versus a cup of coffee.

Imagine a world where "something else" would do that. "Something else" would calculate the prices based on the live demand and sell-side of the assets. Connects all these assets in a framework and starts exchanging them based on the (real-life) current price. That is a world with instant "recording", with no fees while exchanging them. More importantly: without human interference, but transparent and for all to validate. 

The only thing currently up for this task is an algorithm. The algorithm keeps track of the live prices of, for example, nodes, laptops and calculates the exchange rate based on demand and sales. If you relate to other assets like pens, or bonsai trees, the price will be "that" or "that" (instant exchange asset rates). We usually use the money for that. In the future, we might use a (digital) asset framework.

Most of these assets are liquid because there is a comparable p2p market where you can buy the assets from your peers (sort of eBay where all the goods in the world and their exchange prices are connected). In addition, regional efficiencies will likely kick in (water will be more expensive in the Sahara than in the Netherlands).  

Also, note: everything is tokenized that is worth tokenizing and trading. We are most likely not going to tokenize individual crayons. For remembering sake: if there is a price tag or bar code, we will most likely tokenize it. Things that are worth prizing that are worth tokenizing, already priced in the real world will be priced in the digital asset framework, where you can exchange these assets on a p2p market in a decentralized environment, run by an algorithm, in a perfect ledger.

>ðŸ’¡ Rephrase that sentence one more: (1) We have interaction between human beings, (2) where prices are determined on the actual real-life free market, (3) where offer (sell) & demand (buy) meet, (4) where we exchange assets between each other without the delay of the money settlement.

Side note: this framework can't be built on the current blockchains. So we most likely need a few decades ;-) Just imagine the adoption and mindset that is needed before we could be there. I don't know if this will be for the better, but it does offer improvements on the tx cost-efficiency side of things (which was often a reason to take the next step in a system). But once again: imagine the time frame before we are there. Not only technically be ready, but also to wrap our human minds around this (and prepare us as a society). In my opinion, we are slowly moving towards a more and more cost-efficient payment system with the inter-connectivity of entities. And I think an asset framework might be where we end up. 

Hopefully, you enjoyed these money sessions. Before our more techie sessions start in level 2, we will dive a bit more into the current smart contracts and some of the limitations of blockchain technology. 

## Conclusions
Tokenizing assets and exchanging them via a decentralized exchange in an open public ledger, supported by an algorithm, could result in a world without money. The framework of assets in the ledger acts as money. Of course, this is sci-fi for now, but you know what "they" say: sci-fi today, is reality tomorrow ðŸ˜Š
