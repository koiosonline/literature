# BC-1.5.1 First use case: money

## Introduction 

We have a decentralized, public infrastructure. But what are we going to use it for?!
Let's start with one of the essential things when transacting. Let's start with money! Because it's not only one of the most "easiest" ones to tackle (technically) but also one of the most important components of a society's infrastructure. 

>ðŸ’¡ Money is deeply rooted in our society and can be used as a pillar for others. It is of the utmost importance for other applications. Hence the ecosystems first focus on money (Bitcoin) and later other applications (Ethereum). It is a crucial component of other applications. Because if you tackle the money correctly, you can build different applications upon that money layer. Because decentralized applications need decentralized money. Remember the world of Ready Player One? You see that money plays a vital role within that game, so you need money to "exchange value" within the application of that game. Thus, you have human "communication" / value exchange. 
 
## A formality: Bitcoin or bitcoin? 
As a reminder: the first decentralized money is called [bitcoin]( https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin ) (small b) that runs on the [Bitcoin network]( https://bitcoin.org/en/) (big B). The network consists of multiple layers, of which the blockchain ledger and the consensus protocol are important components. The Bitcoin network is sometimes referred to as the Bitcoin infrastructure. The first app built on this infrastructure was bitcoin (the token to incentivize miners). So Bitcoin is a money application with bitcoin as its currency. 

## The why, the Genesis block 

But why did Satoshi invent Bitcoin? In the first block, called the "Genesis block", you can see a hashed piece of data. The data represents the London Times of that day, which stated: "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". Being a statement towards the current monetary system, of course, which failed heavily in 2008.

>ðŸ’¡ Satoshi created an opt-out from the fiat monetary system. A new form of money, with different properties. Money with a fixed supply, governed by a mathematical protocol. Money is well suited for the internet generations and possibly the physical world in time as well. 

But this is not a given: is bitcoin truly money, or is it something else? So if you would like to know the answer to that question, you would first need to understand what money is clearly.  And for that, I will see you in the next session: "What is money?"

## Portfolio assignment 1.5.1 First use case: money


Before we start, write down the answer of what you think "money" should be and for what functions it should or could be used. You are allowed to think outside the box, so we dare you ;-)
