# BC-1.5.8 The money app: other use cases 

This section of "use cases of Bitcoin" can send you in multiple directions. Perhaps even into the universe, when you lose track of time and enter the bitcoin-goes-Star-Trek-mode. We will therefore stick to some major overviews in this introductory level. Then, in later levels, we will discuss all the bitcoin and blockchain paradigms. 

## Get the money app right
>ðŸ’¡ However, before using bitcoin as interplanetary, cross-galactical multi-dimensional money, we first need to get the money application right! We need to master digital money and digital value transfer. 


After we have mastered digital money, it is time to look at other use cases, which we will discuss at a high level to prevent from getting off-topic. If we get the money right, the rest will follow because of the role value transfer plays within those other applications. 

## The use-cases after currency
So we stated several different properties/use cases in the video. Like for example itself sovereign and sound money so that it can be stored in value. It's programmable money so that you can use it, for instance, as an attestation for an academic record. So there are multiple use cases there.

>ðŸ’¡ The web is spread with potential ideas for bitcoin. The challenge is to connect dots, based on your framework which you need to shape with questions and research. An example of financial use cases can be found [here](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/the-5-use-cases-of-bitcoin-in-2021-d2731c280b36)

So is bitcoin already good money? It might be a decent store of value, definitely a good SoV if you compare the run over the last ten years, but less so if you compare it on a day-by-day basis. So it promises a lot of growth and opportunities. However, it currently remains a very young form of money that will need to prove itself over time [the lindy effect needs to kick in]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhYXP550HVo). So it needs to evolve. Luckily the internet and open-source principles massively contribute in this way, so evolution kicks in hard.

Nevertheless, people, systems, and perhaps generations need time to adjust to the new monetary story, supported by experiences from history. It needs to have a proven account of reliability in multiple forms, and then the story will stick. Money is perhaps the most powerful story out there. Almost everybody believes it. People are defending it (the current fiat system) and even attacking other accounts (like Bitcoin) without even realizing what they are defending or attackingâ€”just following a storyline from gifted storytellers. This is why a critical mindset will become a more and more essential skill in the future. You might not get away anymore with blindly following stories. 

Regarding the SoV function of bitcoin, remember that it also all depends on how you measure it. Even if you neglect its future potential, where you might not measure it against fiat anymore, the SoV changes enormously depending on what fiat money you compare it to. In short: it always depends on how you measure it, where you live. So if you measure BTC against the dollar, that is a different SoV than when you measure it against the Argentinian pesos or Turkish Lira, for example. Where BTC devalued from its highest peak in dollars, it increased buying power if you lived in Argentina, Venezuela, Turkey, etc. Once again: it all depends on perspective. For example, wonder what the result would be if you measure it in global SoV? 

So usually money moves after proven to be a good store of value, to a medium of exchange: people rely on it and start accepting it daily (for example, for their work) because they know they can trust and rely on the money. Some people already accept cryptocurrencies for their work, like many of us, of course, who are active in the blockchain scene. This brings me to the second part of the use cases: Increasing transaction cost efficiency. Reducing the transaction cost, like time (how long does it take to get recorded), or the price (how much money it costs me). All the types of friction, as we've discussed. 



>ðŸ’¡ So two things to remember when you're talking about bitcoin use cases:
First, tackle the money app, then start building later.
Reducing transaction costs = increasing the transaction costs efficiency = enabling a ton of other use cases. 


It is not a wrap yet. I want to discuss one benefit which might not have been fully emphasized enough: defending the [freedom of choice]( https://time.com/5486673/bitcoin-venezuela-authoritarian/?source=post_page---------------------------). If you're under a regime that you can't trust, manipulating your monetary system, you now finally have opt-outs of that system thanks to cryptocurrencies. We saw this in 2019 in Venezuela and recently again during the Hong Kong riots. People can't use their payment system anymore because the government is watching the transactions (Hong Kong) or inflating the currency (Venezuela). But citizens still need to transact value. Although prohibited by law, you saw local spikes of the use of bitcoin in Hong Kong during the riots and the year in Venezuela. Good examples of when you as a citizen disagree with your government (tough to stop as government). Not everybody in the world has the luxury to trust their government or the monetary system blindly. So Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies offer people a way out when things get messy.


## Conclusion 
The most important one is that you realize that before we use bitcoin as interplanetary, cross-galactical multi-dimensional money, we first need to get the money application right! Next, we need to master digital money, the digital value transfer (remember: money can be everything). Finally, after we have learned digital money, it is time to look at other use cases, which we all discuss at later levels. 


## Portfolio assignments 1.5.8 The money app: other use cases 

1. What efforts have already been made to reduce transaction costs in the Bitcoin blockchain the past 5 years? Provide at least two examples. 

2. OPTIONAL, NOT MANDATORY: Describe three other applications that have been built on Bitcoin, other than the money application. What other future applications do you see built within the next three years? And within 20 years? If any?
