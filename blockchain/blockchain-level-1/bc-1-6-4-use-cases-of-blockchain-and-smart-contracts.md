# BC-1.6.4 Use cases of blockchain technology 

We still enjoy the benefits of Luca's breakthrough in the middle ages in the recording of transactions. And yet again, might we be on the very brink of reinventing the society of the future. A new concept to automate transactions, which might last another 1,500 years ðŸ˜‰ 

## Just starting, but full of potential 
So imagine the effort it took me when I received the question, "could you think of some use cases of blockchain technology and smart contracts?". Well, many use cases, of course! But as also mentioned before: you must realize that we are in the very early phases (infancy). The tech will need to prove itself. So these are mainly potential use cases + some existing ones that are already out there. So don't get swept away by empty promises and flashy websites. 

But there is some truly fascinating stuff happening already. The main red line in these dApps is reinventing governance and creating new unstoppable decentralized software. For example, in the category "impact in the financial section": integrity verification, digital time stamping, but also think of self-sovereign identities. These might become the fundamental pillars for the next economy, and then we will create new use cases.

## Some old skool examples 
I like the idea of the Augur project. With projects like these, you can use a prediction platform to make an estimation based on masses. Where you can "predict" the future based upon the assessment of a massive group of people. So if you ask one person, "how many kilograms does a hippo weigh?". You'll get all different kinds of estimations. But if you ask ten thousand people what a hippo weighs, the median or the average of all these people's measures is probably very near the truth. The extremes outweigh each other. 

Also known as the power of the big numbers, the power of the masses. You can use this in predictions: who is going to be the next president/who will win this soccer game/what's the weather going to be like tomorrow/What's the price of this financial derivative or the price of Bitcoin going to be or the price of gold?. Creating, of course, tremendous amounts of value and perhaps a better indication of the future. **Unfortunately, it can also be a dangerous thing because masses are not always right.** The token is structured in such a way that you will receive rewards when right and penalties when wrongâ€”reputation mechanisms. 

Another fun example is the Brave browser, which we will show you in more detail later on. It's a browser just like Google Chrome or Firefox. This time, they blocked all the commercials. You can integrate it with a wallet where you can earn money based on your surf behavior. Another example like this is the Opera Browser. You can tip other content creators when you see a good comment on Twitter, for example, when you visit an excellent medium post or an awesome Steem-it post. So basically you earn money by surfing. Brave is still highly centralized, and their token use-cases are heavily debated. Still, imagine a browser that rewards you! 

In short: graze through the different categories. We will zoom in on the three most common categories in the next session.

## Portfolio assignments 1.6.4 Use cases of blockchain technology 

Go to [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en) and research the different tokens and coins (as many as you like!). Highlight your favourite cryptocurrency / project by explaining the smart contract and its use case and why you find it a good use case.
