# BC-1.4.3 Censorship Resistance 

As we have shown you before: centralized ledgers have "rulers", centralized entities, imposing rules.
So, an example of centralized rules imposed on a society, no matter where you are from, you use those rules if you use the Software. An example of this is the Facebook software which doesn't like nudity. So if you upload a page or photo with nudity, you will most likely get blocked or banned because you are not abiding by Facebook's norms & values. Or try to listen to this part of a [music clip from Eminem]( https://youtu.be/gOMhN-hfMtY?t=354).

So what is happening here? The previous example is how censorship looks like: somebody else dictates your rules and limits your freedom. It could be eliminating your holiday photos of a Greek statue with breasts, blocking your webpage as a museum uploading partially nudity art. Listening to your favorite song or letting your voice be heard about a particular topic. A more recent example is the ban by YouTube, Twitter, or LinkedIn of every opinion about corona that was not aligned with the WHO opinion. 

>ðŸ’¡  Open environments and interoperable systems are essential. They offer alternatives not controlled by parties and contribute to opt-out of systems. They, therefore, represent a part of freedom of choice. Luckily, more and more open alternatives are popping up.

American norms and values are in the above scenario imposed on Dutch culture. Because we use their Software, we have to abide by their rules. You saw this in the Chinese example. 

>ðŸ’¡ Software now has the power to impose norms and values. 

We gradually get more dependent on Software, so the dependency on the other norms and values will increase. Software is eating the world. Money will be an application. Money can be seen as speech, a way to express yourself. For example, with what you buy and with whom you transact. Do you want that speech to be monitored by a governmental agency or by a commercial party? What happens if you don't want to follow the rules anymore? You could be switched off in the money system. Censorship resistance = freedom of the individual and freedom of culture (etc.). Freedom to interact the way you want.
