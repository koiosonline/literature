# BC-1.6.2 Smart contracts explained

Some additional information regarding smart contracts in this session.

## A definition from the inventor
We forgot to mention that the term "smart contract" is officially thought up by [Nick Szabo in 1994]( http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html ). 14 years (!) before the Bitcoin whitepaper saw its first daylight. He defined smart contracts as follows: "a smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the term of a contract".

>ðŸ’¡ A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol.

It is computerized because it is digital and automatically where decentral miners record transactions. The miners compute and validate the decision route: they follow the transaction of value. The protocol is the consensus protocol. Proof of Work in the case of Bitcoin, or Proof of Stake in other blockchains (Ethereum migrated from PoW to PoS). "Executes the term of a contract" = which route it will follow.

So once more: a smart contract is a computerized (digital) transaction protocol (sending value via consensus rules). A piece of code on the blockchain that executes the term of a contract (encoded route/decision tree). The miners execute and record these transactions. The general objectives of a smart contract: to satisfy common contractual conditions. "common contractual conditions" = do we both agree on the outcomes if A or if B happens?

## An important limitation
This also creates some limitations in smart contracts. Essential aspects of smart contracts are: once the contract is written, it is written in stone. Or even better than stone, registered in the immutable blockchain ;-) You cannot alter data without changing the hash (smart contracts are also hashed, just like public keys). We will explain this later in level 2 in detail.

>ðŸ’¡ Once launched on the blockchain, you cannot alter a smart contract

## Unstoppable applications
Final added note: a smart contract on a public blockchain is an unstoppable decentralized application. Because when you combine these decision trees, these "if this, then that" routes, if you combine these smart contracts, multiple in a row, all into one colossal decision tree, you can eventually create your application (connect decision trees). And because it runs on a decentralized environment, an open public blockchain, you have a decentralized application ("dApp!").

It means that you can create the same applications as current centralized applications. Only this time: you own the data, so it is self-sovereign. You cannot alter the past (immutable), no trusted third party (and no three risk categories), Censorship resistance. Do you see where I am going with this? It is the same application as before, with way better properties because it cuts out the intermediary and replaces them with an automated protocol. Critical and potential foundation for new economic digital infrastructures like sustainable, peer-to-peer, sharing, and global economies.

We are desperately in need of global economies because we have global problems that need a global solution. Think climate change, think plastic oceans. These problems are problems of the commons. And therefore, we need tools for the commons (in this case) to build on open-source protocols. It is leading us, humanity, into the future. See you in the next class, where we will discuss the first platform that enabled smart contracts & dApps: Ethereum :-)!!

## Portfolio assignments 1.6.2 Smart contracts explained

1. Go to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) (different blockchains and different explorers allowed!) and figure out how to find the code of smart contracts. Donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s normal you donâ€™t understand anything that is in the smart contract. Itâ€™s meant to give you an idea of the reality behind applications. Make a print screen of some parts of the code from the contract / dApp you have chosen and write down your first impressions / initial thoughts.
