The image above always freaks me out a bit because I don't know whether I should like it or whether I should be afraid of it. It comes down to "change".....
And as they say: there's one thing sure in life, one thing "fixed" in life, and that's change (and dying and paying tax, but not so sure about these two ðŸ˜‰). So what you see here in this slide is [life's family tree]( https://www.evogeneao.com/learn/tree-of-life). It is intended to be an easy-to-understand illustration of the core evolution principle; we are related to every living thing and everything that has ever lived on Earth. So in this life's family tree, you see an inevitable development for 4,000 million years, the way we move towards life (here on planet earth). As you can see (on the left side), we're slowly graduating from multiple forms of bacteria to a more and more single interconnected form of life (fewer mammals, visible on the right side). In other words, we are continuously increasing the way that we are interconnected with each other.


## The next phase for us?

For example, 300 years ago, you would have no idea how somebody would live in New Zealand. You couldn't have visited for a holiday. You couldn't see the other side of the world within 24 hours. And imagine how it is nowadays: you can call with whomever you want,
you can send money to whomever you want within seconds, you can travel the world on quite a doable budget (for us that have the luxury). In other words: try to arrange the Olympic Games 2,000 years ago. Good luck with that one!

So we're interconnected, as also recognized as "the world's getting smaller and smaller". So what does this mean: these ledgers that we're using are gradually growing with that movement as well. So you see the same movement, the same evolution as you see in nature, in the tools we are using: internet and blockchain technology is at the forefront of the most recent tools. Which, of course, you can't see in this life tree.

We will post the link to the tree. You can do a deep dive because you see some white spots in the middle. Those were mass extinctions, the most recent one the dinosaurs the reptiles, in the right upper green version. You can learn something or two when you start discovering the tree. Some people claim that humans will be the first species to annihilate themselves (sixth dominant mammal extinction). I have no idea whether that's true. I'm poorly educated in the course of biology.

I am very fascinated about something I once heard [Elon Musk say]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycPr5-27vSI): that there's even a possibility that you could be interconnected with everybody on Earth. Through a chip on the back end of your eye.

So how would that work? You currently often carry a phone in your hand. It's only a moment in time, which might already happen within five to ten years, where it can be integrated into your hand. This is already possible (but then on a mass scale and adopted by the majority of the population). Then the next step, according to that conversation with Musk, would be that you would install the chip on your eyes so that you could see and upload things to the cloud or wherever you store what you're seeing.

It depends (a critical moment in time!): will it be a centralized cloud, or will it be in a decentralized cloud? Do you want somebody to see all the things you are visiting and sheltering off areas because they deem it unfit or do you want to be the only one who sees that? That's a centralized ledger, respectively decentralized ledger. I want to keep my view of the world personally for me alone
(and share them with whom I wish to!).

We are gradually moving to an interconnection because if you have this scenario where you're connected to a cloud, this is, of course, still science fiction. Still, science fiction tomorrow is the reality the day after tomorrow so that you could be connected. Your brains could be plugged into a network where you are connected with all the other people worldwide and perhaps not only people but even with machines. You can find the interview in the further readings, a very cool discussion!

What Elon Musk was telling relates to this life's family tree. **We might all gradually move to one single interconnected entity, as history has shown us**. I have no idea what this entity will look like, but what I do know is that a decentralized infrastructure is a way more formidable ledger (for the individual) to do something like this than a centralized infrastructure. So the movement from centralized to the decentralized ledger is just a thing nature bestowed upon us. It's just the following form of evolution in one of our tools.

**This is one of the main reasons I firmly believe and hope that decentralized ledgers will be the future. Because they allow us / enable us in way better ways to be interconnected with each other than ledgers that have walls around them!

See you in the next session, the last session, about a personal head, start :-)!

## Conclusion

When you look at life's family tree, depicting life on planet earth for the last 400,000,000 years, you will see that we are all gradually moving to a single interconnected entity, as history has shown us. This is one of the main reasons I firmly believe that decentralized ledgers will be the future. Because they allow us / enable us in way better ways to be interconnected with each other than ledgers that have walls around them! Acting alongside a tendency displayed in nature and history alike.
