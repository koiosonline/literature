# BC-1.5.2.1 What is money 1/3

So what's money....? It depends on who you ask. But also when you ask them, and where you ask it :-)! 
What do we mean by that?

>ðŸ’¡ Money has evolved. Money is like a story we humans tell each other (an institution) that keeps changing. 

## Introducing money 

In general, you can give it the following [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money): money is an asset that's widely accepted as payment for goods and services or that's accepted in the repayment for debt. And as you already know: an asset can be tangible, an asset that you can touch. Or it can be intangible (can't physically feel). "Widely accepted" means that it's accepted within a particular community. Communities used to be small but are global now. And as a payment for "goods" (= like an eraser) or "service" (= like to audit my books). Also, as repayment of the debt, which is currently the most known form of our money. As we described previously, we have more than 95% debt-based money. In other words: if everybody starts repaying their debts, we would have (almost) no money.


>ðŸ’¡ So the general definition is that money = any asset that's widely accepted as payment for goods and services or any repayment for debt. The key here is that it can be any form of asset. 

So in the video, we show you a couple of beautiful things over here: for example, a shell. We used to have shells as payments in certain regions, at a specific time in the world. The rarity of certain assets made them more valuable. [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo) wrote a [great article](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/) about it. He concluded that humans tend to collect things. We are "gatherers" of collectibles like exotic shells or kilograms of salt or gold. Or bitcoins. I also see the behavior with my kids: I can give them a bucket, and they start collecting as many things as possible. So it starts early ðŸ˜Š

Other currencies we show in the video are 5 euro ($6), fifty thousand Indonesian Rupiah, approximately a bit more than three euros. A good example of what inflation can do with a currency (the Rupiah). 

>ðŸ’¡ Just as with ledgers, the same goes with money: different forms of money = different properties! And while the ledger evolved, money evolved with it.

## Wealth
A common misconception is that wealth equals money, where wealth is a particular accumulation. An accumulation of money, for example, could also be a car, a house, etc. It's a "store of value". Basically, you "store" your wealth, where money can be seen as a "flow": it goes from hand to hand to hand. It moves like a flow, like, for example, your salary, which you receive periodically. By the way, the word salary comes from the word salt, where salt used to be used as money. So wealth is known as a "stock," and income is known as a "flow".

## Forms of money
What you also need to realize is that money can be anything. For example, imagine that you are in prison and you want to smoke. Cigarettes would, in this case, have value because they are scarce. You can create an ecosystem where cigarettes will function as money: you can use them to buy goods or services. E.g., if you want somebody to be stabbed in the shower (service) or for goods (= soap) or in repayment for debt (=you needed somebody to get stabbed in the shower). I'm diverting from the topic here (sorry for the strange examples). 

>ðŸ’¡ The bottom line: money can be anything. Don't get confused by the argument that money needs to have "intrinsic value". What in life does indeed have intrinsic value? Money is a story that people believe (or not) and often needs to prove itself over time. 

And with that, I would like to close off the session and take you on to the next one: properties of money! If you want a clearer picture, watch [this short clip]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01IusDeSPE4), explaining what money is.
