# BC-1.3 Chapter 3 Satoshi’s cheat

## About this chapter

In 2008, the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a practical solution for the Byzantine General Problem, which enabled the world’s first decentralized ledger: the Bitcoin network. This session is all about this time stamping solution and how it eventually led to a practical Single Source of Truth, agreed upon by all participants in the network. 

## What will we discuss? 
* BC 1.3.1 Satoshi’s Cheat: how did Satoshi solve the BGP? 
* BC 1.3.2 The invention of decentralized digital time (stamping)

## Learning goals 
By the end of this chapter, I can:
1. Explain in my own words how Satoshi invented a practical bypass of the BGP while incorporating the distributed decentralized ledger and the concept of a protocol in my answer (understand)
2. Illustrate how this solution is not a mathematical solution, but a practical solution to the problem (analyse) 
3. Evaluate the impact of the downsides of this practical solution (analyse)
