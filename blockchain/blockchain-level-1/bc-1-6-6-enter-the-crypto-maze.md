# BC-1.6.6  Enter the crypto maze

Kudos that you've made it so far! You understand some of the very introductory basics elements and mental frameworks behind blockchain technology. The important thing of this short session is to realize that there are three main categories of use cases. There are more, but these three we often encounter, and we've seen grow the last five years:


## The three main categories of use cases

1. Sound money (Bitcoin and others).

2. Web3, so the new internet (rearranging software ownership and governance). The internet of value, so to say. Web 3.0 is the decentralized internet, the internet of value, where you own your data. Applications with built-in self-sovereign identity, peer-to-peer engagement, ownership, etc. Fascinating stuff that will radically transform the way we act online. But, it will take at least ten years to build this.

A large part of web3 is currently visible in the NFT hype. We will discuss this later, but if you can't wait, go check out these [NFT explorer tools]( https://rarity.tools/) or [open market places]( https://opensea.io/).

3. Open Finance ("DeFi"). Claiming to aim for more inclusivity, slowly proving this via [applications]( https://axieinfinity.com/) where you can play, learn and earn. The space is building towards fairer transparency in finance, "open finance", but so far has just started launching the first decentralized applications. It is not very user-friendly, hidden for those who need it the most, but very promising because they eliminate intermediaries. Intermediaries like [banks]( https://app.bancor.network/eth/data), [exchanges]( https://dydx.exchange/), automated market makers](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap), or others. Finance with transparency and open accessibility for all. With lower fees and direct connection with fellow peers. It could be encrypted and private, based on the blockchain you select. But without exclusion, without loss of records/walls/people hiding information, without dishonesty.

## The ICO's on Ethereum
We have new forms of governance implemented in finance, offered via the internet. So, an example of this is the ERC 20 token in Ethereum, the famous contract for ICO's. Where you have crowdfunding without a centralized party, so crowdfunding between pairs. You can have an excellent idea for some very cool software. You can upload your idea in a pool, e.g., and then, of course, people can transparently fund you. What happened, of course: a lot of people abused the system, and a lot of people got filthy rich, and a lot of people got scammed. But the basic idea of peer-to-peer funding is enabled by these new forms of governance. So when we talk about new forms of governance, we mean stuff like this: peer-to-peer funding, so funding without platforms that withhold information or ask for fees. Uber without an Uber, Airbnb without Airbnb. A crowdfunding platform without a crowd funder. Based on P2p transactions, it is very interesting!


## The phase of blind people describing elephants
All based on the concepts of smart contracts. Smart contracts are talking with each other, creating new decentralized applications, and even creating new forms of webs (internet). I always like this quote, where we currently operate like blind men describing an elephant. We have no idea how it's going to look like, we have a fundamental notion, and of course, some people around the world can make an estimated guess and build the dApps. These builders don't know all the answers and are experimenting as well. But they are out there, innovating the internet. We will get a hold of them at later levels and let them explain the nitty-gritty parts themselves! They will each describe their part of the elephant üòä

## Under the hood tech
Realize that blockchain technology is an under the hood technology. We're talking about something that you, as an end-user, might not even see. An example: you're using the internet without understanding how the internet works. The same way you're going to use decentralized applications, without knowing how a blockchain works and perhaps without even realizing that you use blockchain technology. But this will take time. The infrastructure is out in the open because everybody is building on it.

Hopefully, you've learned many things here on this introductory course. We aim to have inspired you to continue and get a real proper grasp of the basics. The following chapters will get a bit more technical. So far, we have acted on a high level. And for economics: we will dive deeper into the game theories, etc. Before we do that, we will finish this session off with the social-economic consequences. The final session is just my brain dumping some stuff on you. Therefore really looking forward to this last session üòä

If you can't wait and want to start with the basics of blockchains, go ahead and skip towards session 2.1. But if you would like to see how the future matrix on the blockchain might look like, please hold on. Say what? Click and go to 1.7!

## Conclusion
Three main categories of use cases we currently seem to be focussing on

1. Sound money
2. Open Finance
3. Web 3.0

Use-cases based on a backbone of decentralized ledgers and smart contracts that result in "dApps". Creating new possibilities, a new infrastructure, that you as an end-user might even never see nor need to understand.
