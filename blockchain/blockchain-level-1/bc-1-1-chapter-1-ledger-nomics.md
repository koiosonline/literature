# BC-1.1 Chapter 1 Ledgernomics

## About this chapter?
Blockchain technology is ledger technology. To understand blockchain technology, you need to understand the basics and importance of ledgers in general. This article introduces the chapter that will help you with this. Welcome to chapter "Ledgernomics ðŸ“’"!

## What will we discuss?

BC 1.1.1 What is a ledger?

BC 1.1.2 The importance of ledgers


BC 1.1.3 The history of ledgers


BC 1.1.4 Introducing the "perfect ledger."


BC 1.1.5 What is a centralized ledger?


BC 1.1.6 Problems with centralized ledgers


BC 1.1.7 Distributed, decentralized ledgers


BC 1.1.8 Problems with distributed and decentralized ledgers


BC 1.1.9 The Byzantine General Problem (BGP)


BC 1.1.10 Centralized and decentralized ledgers compared

## Learning goals 
By the end of this chapter, I can



1. Describe in my own words what a ledger is by explaining why this is important for society as well as me personally (understand)
2. Reflect on what a perfect ledger is by illustrating that we are still far away from this type of ledger (analyze )
3. Explain what the differences are between centralized and decentralized ledgers (understand)
4. Evaluate how the different problems of centralized ledgers (could) impact current society and its infrastructures (evaluate)
5. Explain how decentralized ledgers could solve the problems of centralized ledgers by removing the TTP (understand)
6. Explain what the difference is between a distributed and a decentralized ledger (understand)
7. Illustrate the different problems of distributed decentralized ledgers by the example of the Byzantine General Problem (analyze)

## Chapter introduction
During this course, we will focus on open, public blockchains. However, we do discuss other types of blockchains as well, like closed-off, private variants. We will motivate this choice later in the curriculum but know that we generally mean open and public blockchains if we mention ' blockchains'.

>ðŸ’¡  *Butâ€¦.hold on? Say what again?! What is an open public blockchain???* No worries, we will apply a step-by-step approach. So by the end of this course, you can dream the answers to the question above. And perhaps even better: you can ask better questions! **That's our final course goal: to enable you to ask better questions. And help you search for answers or perspectives.**

For now, let's just start with the very first step. Blockchain technology is ledger (!) technology, wherein short a blockchain is a "(1) distributed", "(2) decentralized", "(3) ledger". So let's talk about ledgers first. The other two components will follow in later classes. Chapter Ledgernomics will explain what a ledger is and why they play a vital role in societies. We will also show you the history of these ledgers and how they evolvedâ€”gradually moving towards their most recent form: a blockchain. Of course, a blockchain is way more than just a ledger, and that's the beauty. But more about that in other chapters. No worries, we got you covered. Pieces will fall together!

After the history of ledgers, will we discuss our most common variants: the "centralized ledgers". These are ledgers controlled by "Trusted Third Parties (TTP)". Eventually, we will arrive at "decentralized" and explain what that is. Finally, we will compare these variants, where we discuss the benefits and downsides of both. By the end of this section, you'll know a lot more about Ledger Technology. After some quizzes and assignments, you are probably ready to dive into the next chapter 2: "what is a blockchain"! 

But first, let's talk basics here ðŸ˜ƒ. Let's lay some groundwork and fundamentals. So let's start with Ledger Technology. Enjoy yourself in this new adventure, and we will see you in the next session, where we will discuss what a "Ledger" is.
