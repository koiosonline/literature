# BC-1.5.6 Who dares threaten the status quo?

In this session, we will discuss "who dares threaten the status quo", where we will discuss the competition of current banking systems.

## The competition

(1) Decentralized contestants
(2) Big tech companies like Amazon, WeChat, Facebook, and Apple
(3) Central bank digital currencies (will be discussed in more detail in later levels)


As discussed: innovation is limited for banks due to legislation. Due to strict KYC and AML procedures, banks can't just "experiment with (open and public) blockchain". They can't just do these things because they are held accountable according to a multitude of laws. And the laws don't work all that well, as many cases of money laundering by banks prove each week. "If you would like to launder money, get a banking license" (Andreas Antonopoulos).

In this class, we will compare several things. For example, the Bitcoin infrastructure and the benefits and downsides compared with the current banking system. We will encounter the properties of money as discussed before. Finally, we will do the same thing for the big tech competitors.


<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac"> ‚ùì Who will issue our money in the next 50 years? The government once again (CBDC)? Or will the fiat of commercial banks hold? What about Apple Pay, Google Wallet, WeChat, PayPal, Venmo, Amazon Pay? Or Facebook Libra? Do you trust them with your money and data? And what about in 50 years? And can we trust infant technology like Bitcoin with a deflationary monetary policy? </blockquote>

## Comparison tables & DYOR

You will encounter many of these types of comparisons. Based on the preference of the creator, certain properties are compared and subjectively graded. So if somebody else thinks it's a green and high score, it doesn't mean that this information is accurate.

>üí° Be very critical and do your own research #DYOR!

An easy way to do this is to compare sources and discuss opinions. Truly listen to other arguments and try to connect the dots. Doing your research is digging in a bit deeper than watching YouTube clips or trusting flashy pictures on the Internet.  

Let's discuss the image above. The traits of money: as you know, there are multiple properties of money. From top to down: fungibility, portability, durability, scarcity, and even predictability in supply in this case. How to use this, when is something good or bad? It all depends on how you use the currency? So gold for comparison with fiat money: gold is a better store of value, but try paying your local grocery shop with gold. The same thing goes for Bitcoin: try to pay with bitcoin in your local grocery shop. The situation might change in the future as well. The world is moving and not static.

If you compare these charts, you can easily see that a crypto/bitcoin enthusiast most likely writes this one. They picked the properties where Bitcoin scores high. Here they only show the benefits of Bitcoin. What they don't show, but what you can find in the next image, is the established stable history (essential for trust). Or if you can pay your tax with it. Both might be possible in the (near) future but are still worth mentioning compared to fiat. People need time to adjust to the new money, the new story, the new institution. To become a good form of money, you need to have a basic historical foundation of trust. People need to trust the new form of money, and for that, you need time. It might not go as fast as crypto geeks like us hope so. Still, the foundations of a decentralized mathematical protocol are very good to build up trust.

Other comparisons not taken into account and in favor of bitcoin (**ü°® see what I did there‚Ä¶?**):
* Censorship resistance
* Open & Global
* No central authority
* Transactions & balances in blockchain
* Electronically
* Programmable
* New forms of monetary policy (Hayek)
* Opt-in system
* Finality / irreversible
* Interoperable?
* Less systematic risk
* Predictable

## Some guidelines on surviving in a fast moving world
>üí° Remain critical and do Your Research. Don't become a parrot

>üí° Think in complementary opposites

>üí° Stay humble and listen to others. It will bring you many new insights (you can't be right all the time üòâ)!


## Transparent, predictable trust

So bitcoin is still very young in this regard. It's only ten years old. Step 1 is to prove itself as a good store of value. Of course, it doesn't permanently store your value in the short term, compared to dollars: you go up, you come down, you go up, etc. These fluctuations keep decreasing, though. Bitcoins used to in- and decrease in more percentage. The instability becomes smaller and smaller in %, but the amounts get bigger (because we go up, the amount increases). But as you can see, based on the current use case of Bitcoin, international cross-border (digital, sound, self-sovereign) money will grow to a sort of an optimum. Just as oil did before, and just as gold did, and as many other forms of store value did in the past: you can see a similar trend with Bitcoin (collectible --> volatile --> stable).

## Money moves from collectible to Sov to MoE to UoA

According to the histories of many monies before, after collectible to SoV, money is becoming a medium of exchange. Bitcoin currently isn't very well suited for a payment in your local grocery shop. However, developers are working hard to improve this as well. So this doesn't mean that, with Lightning Network or other scalable forms coming up, that being a medium of change isn't possible in the future. Once again: build up trust by proving that you are a reliable form of money.

>üí° Trust in the story goes much easier if you use transparent and predictable outcomes to validate yourself.

Just as we couldn't scale up the Internet at the beginning of the '90s, we currently have similar problems scaling up open public blockchains. So I genuinely believe that we will succeed. Only the main question is how are we going to do that? And that we will discuss later on because you can go into specific multiple directions.

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac"> ‚ùì Do you believe Bitcoin will eventually become a global unit of account (end phase of money)? And if so, in what timeline? </blockquote>

[Bitcoin-Libra from Libra perspective](https://getlibra.net/?topic=bitcoin-vs-libra-infographic)

Check these comparisons overviews at your leisure. I also added one which discusses Bitcoin versus the Libra type coins. The Facebook token in this case. Because what's the crux here is that nowadays, banks need to fight one opponent or the other. They have in one corner a decentralized version of money, which you can't attack or regulate that easily, but where many have tried before. But in the other corner stands perhaps a more formidable opponent in the regard of offering payment services (not of being money or ledger, just the benefits): the very highly skilled, highly funded big tech companies launching their first test-cases like Libra.


For example, in the adoption theory, as soon as Facebook is legally allowed to roll out their Libra token, they will have 2 billion users. And, of course, they have a highly skilled and colossal team specializing in using your dopamine factors. So try to compete with that while your hands are bound by laws. The previous laws that protected you are now your very limitations.

## Blockchains offer more than money
 
So if we compare these things, I made a top list of the nine most essential aspects. Next, you can see how government fiat scores against cryptocurrencies. It will give you a basic overview of the different properties‚Äîone final closing before we finish off the session.

![Source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koiosonline/literature-images/main/blockchain-level1/bc-1-5-6-who-dares-threaten-the-status-quo-image1.png)

Suppose you compare a decentralized infrastructure and its cryptocurrency (Bitcoin & bitcoin or Ethereum & Ether) with mere money and therefore neglect the possibilities of the ledger itself. In that case, you are missing some essential elements. Don't forget that bitcoin is only the currency that runs on Bitcoin, where it can be more than money. So if you're using a "Bitcoin versus fiat money" comparison, then do realize that you're comparing one minor aspect of the possibilities it can entice. Bitcoin can be programmed and used for more things than just money (it contains a ledger :) ). So basically, it's a comparison between apples and oranges. Still, I think that's pretty clear for you by now as well.

Just scope these comparisons for a while and remain critical, of course. But, then, form your own opinion and try to critically approach your idea (why shouldn't you be correct, what can be a counterargument, and would that be a valid one?).

After that, I think it's now time for us to send you preparation and star gazing towards the world's very first open and decentralized public ledger: Bitcoin.

## Conclusions
In this session, we used some of the comparison overviews you often find on the Internet. Keep in mind that you are only comparing the monetary elements of cryptocurrencies when you compare them with money. Don't forget all the other possibilities that remain of having a decentralized ledger (can record different forms of data other than money and in other ways). The main message is that you should always remain very critical, not only regarding these types of overviews which are often very opinionated but mostly on your own opinions. Just try to counter your ideas; why should you be wrong? Often the world doesn't operate in a straight line üòä
