# BC-1.6.5 Do I need a blockchain? 

This is a session we already discussed in multiple different locations. Because we got asked this question so many times, we made a separate chapter. We added some further readings to summarize it. If this is clear already,  feel free to skip it üòä 


## Private, Hybrid & Public blockchains
In the past, there have been many attempts to create many different types of blockchains. And many have "failed" (but the ecosystem learned valuable lessons!). Because most blockchains often didn't build for Commons, or the use case didn't fit the type of blockchain. There wasn't enough technical expertise, or more importantly, the ecosystem wasn't big enough. Massive companies are building centralized ledgers. And there are these open public varieties built by communities. Finally, we have some blockchains in between (centralized and decentralized), called hybrids. 

It is essential to realize that you have the benefits of open public ledgers if you use an open public ledger. If you use centralized, you have the advantages of a centralized, more efficient local ledger. But also, of course, the three main risk categories. There is not anything new under the horizon with centralized ledgers. Other than that, you're using a cryptographically secure database.

## Determine the use case
So as mentioned before, if you want to decide "Do I need a blockchain?", first of all, determine the use case. Do you want to increase your profit margin? And you don't like to share your data with the entire world, for example? Do you want to gain market share, or do you want to create synergy with competition and share this synergy with them? Then centralized (ledgers) might be more interesting (but this was already possible 40 years ago). These are often not technological challenges stopping centralized innovation, but political choices (not willing to work with competition etc.).

Suppose you would like to build for the commons, or would like to offer open transparent services. In that case, an open public ledger might be better suited. On the other hand, if you're a bit hesitant (about the future), you might go for a hybrid variety. Realize though: all the aspects and trade-offs that apply to ledger's are still applicable  (centralized vs. decentralized).

*As a reminder:*
Killer-app Bitcoin = money app
Killer-app Ethereum = new forms of governance

**Tip to find the goal: what is the need of the end user?** 

## Open Public Blockchains are not fully trustless! 

Blockchains do not just create ‚Äúmagic internet money‚Äù. It is an ‚Äúunder the hood technology‚Äù. You probably will have to rely on people or services somewhere on the road and Bitcoin therefore isn‚Äôt fully trustless. There is still some degree of trust. How many users have read the source code of Bitcoin for example, or can read C++? And are you sure the protocol cannot be changed? There's no guarantee that a consensus will not form in the future to alter the program in a materially significant way that some users will not desire. The same holds true for any consensus protocol.


## Your live, your choice
The beauty is that it is entirely up to you. For the first time you actually have a choice:  an opt in or opt out option for which system to select. Happy? Uneasy? Most importantly: be curious, open for changes and opinions and be critical. 

*‚ÄúOrdinary cruelty is simple stupidity. It comes from the entire want of imagination. It is the result in our days of stereotyped systems, of hard-and-fast rules, of centralization, of officialism, and of irresponsible authority. Whenever there is centralization there is stupidity. What is inhuman in modern life is officialism. Authority is as destructive to those who exercise it as it is to those on whom it is exercised.‚Äù* ‚Äï Oscar Wilde
