A short session. The third example, also known as the single-point-of-failure: banks often get hacked.
And not only banks but also the other involved intermediaries (Visa, Mastercard, etc.). As discussed before: where Bitcoin is peer-to-peer, our current monetary system is peer-five intermediaries -peer. For fun: check out how many icons there are on your bank pas. So there are at least five intermediaries on a regular transaction, on a local scale.

If you are going across borders, more and more intermediaries (+ ledgers) will be added. So not only will all these intermediaries have access to your monetary data, but they also store the data. Anybody who hacks one of these intermediaries will have your data as well. This happens weekly. For example, in the Netherlands, a boy of 16 years old managed to hack two banks and one government institute in one weekend. And not his first time. 

So single-point-of-failures are very much applicable to our current banking system. How many times have you read that banks make errors, for example? Because it is not an append-only ledger and because a single centralized party controls it, you now have more vulnerabilities within the system. Complex systems are more vulnerable. If you want to learn more about this or an attack, just read about the "Carbanak Cyber gang" and how they stole $ 1 bln from a bank. Modern-day robberies won't be with blazing guns anymore, but with blazing keystrokes :-)

## Conclusion
The current banking system operates with many different intermediaries, all of which have access to your data (even if you make a 1$ payment). So if one of them gets hacked, your data is available to the hacker. Having a centralized ledger makes it interesting to attack that kind of a ledger because of the "single-point-of-failure" risk.
