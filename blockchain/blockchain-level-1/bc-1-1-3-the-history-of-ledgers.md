# BC-1.1.3 The history of ledgers 

So you know now what a ledger is, a tool to record transactions that transfer value, and why they are important: the four aspects discussed before. But what you most likely never gave a second thought is that they keep evolving. Just think about it: compare our current forms with the first ones we found as humanity. Over 7,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq, they used massive clay tablets to record values like grain. So we have some experience as a species with recording value.

>💡 A critical keynote for this entire course and possibly for your world view: **if the ledger changes, society can change with it.**

It is a bit like the chicken or the egg story of which one came first. Sometimes society (chicken) demands a new form of the ledger (egg). But sometimes, a fresh egg creates a new society (chicken). New forms enable us to reorganize ourselves. So it seems like it can go both ways. History has proven again and again that ledgers and society change hand in hand. But it takes more research to be sure which one initiates the other.

## A few examples
Imagine running current society on clay tablets: our global banking systems and all their transactions on a physical clay tablet will not happen. So the form we use enables and limits our capabilities. Improvements allow us to reshape society. Just think about the impact of introducing digital ones last century.

Another famous example brings us back to 494 AD. An Italian monk named Luca Pacioli invented a new way to record transactions. So not a change of ledger, but a difference in how you record transactions WITHIN that ledger.

>💡 So there are, at least, two ways how you can improve ledger technology: 
(1)  By enhancing the ledger itself 
(2) By improving how you record transactions

One thousand five hundred years ago, Luca invented "double-entry accounting". A new way of recording each transaction twice. In two different places instead of the previous single place (more about this later!). For now: why is this important? This upgrade in transaction recording enabled us to lend out money! Previous versions could not do this. Re-imagine the example where you recorded the txs of friends. That example was single-entry accounting. You only entered each transaction once. Try to visualize a recording of debt in that type? The money was either with friend A or friend B. You had no system in place to record debt. How to structure these transactions, like lending out money (you physically give it away, but it is still yours), was solved 1500 years ago.

Well. All good and that. But who cares?! Well, ladies and gents. We are talking about immense new rising powers here. World domination, and all.

## Power
In this case, a new world power arose. The concept of debt and increase in liquidity created immense economic growth in Italian regions (fun fact: we still use this method of accounting).

There, in the middle regions of Italy, a new form arose. A system where people could lend out money but still had a recorded claim of ownership. New businesses popped up. Italy grew out to become a more powerful entity and force to reckon with in the world. Mighty families, like the Medicis, arose as well. There is even a Netflix series about it a millennium later?! If you want to see this with your own eyes, you should visit Firenze (Florence). It shows all the wealth this family gathered.

>💡 Do note that we are not historians and that I used to be an accountant. So I might be biased regarding the importance. Many other factors have an impact well. But we claim that improved ledgers allow for improvements in recording and attributing value, allowing humans to reorganize via new forms of transacting with more efficiency. Sometimes new values, like debt or Bitcoin, are created in the process. 

Whether we are better off than 5000 years ago, I do not know. Still, we have improved our financial storytelling and economic growth. So let's find out if we can catch other values than monetary values. The blockchain seems up for this task. But more about that in later classes, we are not yet finished with this session 😊

>💡  With these improvements, the influence of ledgers, their impact, and their role in our lives also increase. We kept on building further and further, creating more extensive and complex systems. 

You could perfectly function in society without using ledgers 7,000 years ago, like living on the land. But current-day society has become so complicated that it is nearly impossible (and most likely not wanted) to survive without ledgers in current society. You can survive off course, live a "simple" living somewhere in the woods, but "civilized" societies run on ledgers and are immensely dependent on them. **So, ledgers evolve. The way we record transactions evolve. And they have an increasingly growing impact on our everyday life.**

**We want to mention one final important thing in this session.** Although we use these ledgers ourselves, we often appoint a party to record our transactions and maintain the books. The party is known as the Trusted Third Party (TTP). These TTP's grew over time, eventually resulting in several centralized, powerful entities and getting increasingly more and more powerful. So imagine the possibilities in our previous example where you controlled the recording. In this world, you decide who owns what money (within boundaries!). And where you would have insight into all the transactions. And you are hard to be checked because your ledger is not openly accessible. Plus, the monetary system has grown very complex over the centuries. So there are several risks in this example where you, as a centralized entity, run a "centralized" ledger. But more about that later. 

>💡 These parties that maintain these ledgers are called Trusted Third Parties (TTP = important term!!). They support the ledgers our society runs on and therefore have a lot of power.

## Conclusion
Ledgers keep evolving. History has proven that every time a ledger develops, society evolves with it. Or, if communities need a new solution to face challenges, a new form is invented. Just imagine the challenges we face in the 21st century. We lack a tool that can adequately record other values than money, on a global scale, without being manipulated by powerful entities. Yet, we as a species keep striving to improve the ledger to solve the challenges we face. 

But to what end goal, where do we stop? In other words, how might a perfect ledger look like? That we will see in the next course 😊!

## Portfolio assignment 1.1.3 The history of ledgers
Before we move forward to the next lesson, brainstorm with yourself, a friend, or a Koios member what you think a perfect ledger could and should look like. How would it function, and which unique characteristics would it have in an ideal world? Tip: you can look up papers online about this topic. During class, you might be invited to discuss why you think your perfect ledger is perfect. Remember, opinions can change, and it's not bad if yours does too. We are here to learn with each other.
